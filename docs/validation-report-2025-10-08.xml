## Failed Items
None

## Partial Items
None

## Additional Findings

⚠ PARTIAL - Docker Compose Configuration Inconsistency
Evidence: The client/docker-compose.yml supports both local .env.local and Portainer stack variables, but server/docker-compose.yml only references .env (not .env.local) and lacks clear documentation about Portainer variable overrides.
Impact: This inconsistency creates different deployment patterns between client and server, which could cause confusion during development and deployment.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Docker Compose configuration inconsistency between client and server
2. Should Improve:
   - Update server/docker-compose.yml to support .env.local for local development
   - Add clear documentation about Portainer variable overrides in server/docker-compose.yml
   - Ensure consistent deployment patterns between client and server
3. Consider: None

The story context document is complete and well-structured, meeting all requirements from the checklist. However, there is a configuration inconsistency between client and server docker-compose.yml files that should be addressed as part of implementing story 1.10.

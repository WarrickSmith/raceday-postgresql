- **Critical Issues:** 0

## Checklist Results

### ✓ PASS - Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured

**Evidence:** Lines 13-15
```xml
<asA>a developer</asA>
<iWant>Docker container configured for Node.js 22 server with separate deployment from client</iWant>
<soThat>I can run the server application with consistent resource allocation on independent infrastructure</soThat>
```

All three story fields accurately extracted from the source story.

### ✓ PASS - Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)

**Evidence:** Lines 66-77
```xml
<acceptanceCriteria>
  <criterion id="1">Dockerfile created for Node.js 22 LTS Alpine base image</criterion>
  <criterion id="2">Multi-stage build (dependencies → build → runtime)</criterion>
  <criterion id="3">Container CPU limit: 4 cores</criterion>
  <criterion id="4">Container memory limit: 4GB</criterion>
  <criterion id="5">Health check configured (curl localhost:7000/health)</criterion>
  <criterion id="6">Environment variables passed via docker-compose</criterion>
  <criterion id="7">Volume mounts for logs (if needed)</criterion>
  <criterion id="8">Container restart policy: unless-stopped</criterion>
  <criterion id="9">Separate docker-compose.yml file for server deployment (independent from client)</criterion>
  <criterion id="10">Server API accessible on port 7000 (externally mapped from container port 3000)</criterion>
</acceptanceCriteria>
```

All 10 acceptance criteria from the original story are captured exactly with no modifications or inventions.

---

### ✓ PASS - Tasks/subtasks captured as task list

**Evidence:** Lines 16-63

The context includes all 5 tasks with complete subtask breakdowns:
- Task 1: Create server Dockerfile (3 subtasks)
- Task 2: Create server docker-compose.yml (7 subtasks)
- Task 3: Move client docker-compose.yml (3 subtasks)
- Task 4: Update documentation (4 subtasks)
- Task 5: Test deployment (4 subtasks)

All tasks properly linked to their corresponding acceptance criteria via `acs` attributes.

---

### ✓ PASS - Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets

**Evidence:** Lines 80-93

Four highly relevant documentation artifacts included:
1. tech-spec-epic-1.md (Docker Configuration L270-376)
2. architecture-specification.md (Deployment Architecture L689-807)
3. developer-quick-start.md (Quick Setup L1-50)
4. tech-spec-epic-1.md (Environment Configuration L379-425)

Each doc includes path, title, section reference with line numbers, and meaningful snippet describing relevance to Docker configuration story.

---

### ✓ PASS - Relevant code references included with reason and line hints

**Evidence:** Lines 94-104

Three code artifacts identified:
1. `/docker-compose.yml` (lines 1-60) - Existing client config to be moved
2. `/client/Dockerfile` (lines 1-95) - Multi-stage build template reference
3. `/server/src/database/migrate.ts` (lines 1-37) - Migration directory requirements

Each artifact includes kind, symbol, line range, and explicit reason explaining relevance to the story implementation.

---

### ✓ PASS - Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable

**Evidence:** Lines 130-140

Three critical interfaces extracted:
1. **GET /health** - REST endpoint (server/src/api/health.ts)
2. **DATABASE_URL** - Environment variable with PostgreSQL connection string format
3. **Migration Volume Mount** - Docker volume signature for database initialization

Each interface includes name, kind, path/signature, and description of its role in the Docker configuration.

---

### ✓ PASS - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns

**Evidence:** Lines 120-129

Eight specific constraints documented:
1. Multi-stage Docker build requirement
2. Separate docker-compose files for deployment independence
3. Port mapping strategy (3000→7000)
4. Resource limits (4 CPU, 4GB RAM)
5. PostgreSQL health check dependency
6. Migration mount location
7. Restart policy requirement
8. Health check endpoint accessibility

All constraints are typed and directly relevant to Docker configuration implementation requirements.

---

### ✓ PASS - Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks

**Evidence:** Lines 105-117

Dependencies organized by ecosystem:
- **Docker:** node:22-alpine, postgres:18-alpine
- **Node:** typescript, pg
- **System:** curl (for health checks)

Each dependency includes version where applicable and purpose description. Correctly identifies both container-level and application-level dependencies.

---

### ✓ PASS - Testing standards and locations populated

**Evidence:** Lines 141-162

**Standards (lines 142-144):**
> "Tests use Vitest framework (^2.1.9) with TypeScript strict typing. Integration tests validate Docker container behavior using shell commands (docker inspect, curl)..."

**Locations (lines 145-148):**
- server/tests/integration/*.test.ts
- server/tests/deployment/docker.test.ts

**Test ideas (lines 149-162):** 12 test scenarios mapped to acceptance criteria including:
- AC 1-10 coverage (Dockerfile build, multi-stage, CPU/memory limits, health check, env vars, volumes, restart policy, compose separation, port mapping)
- Additional postgres and migration tests

---

### ✓ PASS - XML structure follows story-context template format

**Evidence:** Lines 1-165

Document perfectly follows the story-context template structure:
- ✅ Root element: `<story-context>` with id and version
- ✅ Metadata section (lines 2-10)
- ✅ Story section with asA/iWant/soThat/tasks (lines 12-64)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria (lines 66-77)
- ✅ Artifacts with docs/code/dependencies (lines 79-118)
- ✅ Constraints (lines 120-129)
- ✅ Interfaces (lines 130-140)
- ✅ Tests with standards/locations/ideas (lines 141-163)

All required sections present and properly structured per template.

## Recommendations

### Excellent Work
1. ✅ All checklist items passed with comprehensive evidence
2. ✅ Story context is complete and developer-ready
3. ✅ Strong technical detail with line number references throughout
4. ✅ Clear mapping between tasks, acceptance criteria, and test ideas

### Minor Enhancements (Optional)
1. Consider adding epic-stories-2025-10-05.md as a doc artifact for traceability to original epic planning
2. Could expand test ideas to include negative test cases (e.g., verify build fails without required env vars)
3. May add constraint about Portainer-specific deployment considerations mentioned in Dev Notes

### Overall Assessment
**VALIDATION PASSED** - Story context is complete, accurate, and provides all necessary information for implementation. No critical or blocking issues identified.

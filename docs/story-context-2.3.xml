    <iWant>a worker thread pool (3 workers) for money flow calculations</iWant>
    <soThat>CPU-intensive work doesn't block the main event loop and enables concurrent race processing</soThat>
    <tasks>
      - Create server/src/workers/worker-pool.ts with WorkerPool class (AC: 1, 6, 7)
      - Create server/src/workers/transformWorker.ts worker script (AC: 2, 3)
      - Implement worker lifecycle management (AC: 4, 8)
      - Implement task queuing and assignment (AC: 5, 6)
      - Add structured logging with Pino (AC: 9)
      - Write unit tests for worker pool
      - Integration test: Initialize pool and verify worker readiness
    </tasks>
  </story>

  <acceptanceCriteria>
    1. Worker pool class created with configurable worker count (default: 3) that exports a singleton pool instance for application-wide use
    2. Worker threads instantiated from transformWorker.ts script using Node.js Worker API with message-passing IPC
    3. Workers communicate via postMessage() / on('message') pattern, passing typed payloads validated with Zod schemas
    4. Workers handle uncaught errors and 'error' events by logging details and triggering graceful restart (crash → restart flow scaffolded, Story 2.11 adds full retry logic)
    5. Pool queues tasks when all workers are busy, maintaining FIFO order and preventing task loss
    6. Pool tracks each worker's status (idle / busy) and exposes metrics for observability (active count, queue depth)
    7. exec(data) method returns Promise&lt;TransformedRace&gt; that resolves when worker completes transform, rejects on worker failure
    8. Worker pool initialized on application startup (in server/src/index.ts or dedicated bootstrap module) before scheduler starts
    9. Structured logging via Pino for: worker start, task assignment, task completion, worker crash/restart with contextual data (workerId, taskId, duration)

      <doc path="docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md" title="Technical Specification: Epic 2 - High-Performance Data Pipeline" section="Services and Modules - Worker Pool">
        Defines Worker Pool module at workers/worker-pool.ts with 3-worker configuration. Workers execute CPU-bound money-flow transforms without blocking event loop. Maintains three worker threads, queues tasks if all busy, tracks worker status (idle/busy), exports exec(data) method returning Promise. Logs worker start, task assignment, task completion, worker crash/restart.

  <constraints>
    - Module location: server/src/workers/ per architecture specification
    - ESM imports with .js extensions required (Node.js 22 standard)
    - Zero 'any' types policy enforced by TypeScript strict mode and ESLint
    - Singleton pattern for worker pool instance (prevent multiple pools competing for CPU)
    - Worker count fixed at 3 (NFR011: 3 workers + 1 CPU for orchestrator = 4 cores total)
    - All message payloads validated with Zod schemas
    - Structured logging with Pino (no console.log in production)
    - Graceful shutdown pattern matching database pool (close workers on SIGTERM/SIGINT)
    - FIFO task queuing to prevent task loss and ensure fair processing order
    - Worker restart on crash (basic flow in this story, full retry logic in Story 2.11)
    - Story 2.4 will add actual money flow calculation logic; this story provides infrastructure with passthrough/echo worker

    <ideas>
      AC1: Test worker pool initialization with configurable size (default 3)
      AC2: Test worker thread creation from transformWorker.ts script
      AC3: Test postMessage/on('message') communication pattern with mock workers
      AC4: Test worker crash handling (error event) triggers restart
      AC5: Test task queuing when all workers are busy (FIFO order)
      AC6: Test worker status tracking (idle → busy → idle transitions)
      AC7: Test exec() Promise resolves on success, rejects on worker failure
      AC8: Integration test: Pool initializes on app startup before scheduler
      AC9: Test structured logging for worker start, task assignment, task completion, crash/restart events

      Additional test ideas:
      - Test concurrent task execution across multiple workers
      - Test queue depth metrics accuracy
      - Test graceful shutdown (workers terminate cleanly on SIGTERM)
      - Test worker restart doesn't affect other workers
      - Test exec() rejects when worker postMessage fails
      - Test Zod validation failures in worker message payloads

## Canonical Reference

- Primary requirements currently live under the project PRD: [PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md](./PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md#epic-2-high-performance-data-pipeline)

## Hand-off Notes

1. Run the BMAD PRD workflow for Epic 002 to produce a standalone artifact in `docs/epics/epic-002/`.
2. Replace this pointer with the generated PRD path, including version metadata and reviewers.
3. Notify stakeholders once the Epic 002 PRD receives approval so downstream planning can reference the finalized document.

## Next Action Required

**What to do next:** Implement Story 2.10E (Client Application PostgreSQL Migration)

**Recommended:** Generate story context first for comprehensive implementation guidance

**Command to run (option 1):** Stay with SM agent and run `story-context` workflow to generate implementation context

**Command to run (option 2):** Load DEV agent and run `dev-story` workflow to implement directly

**Agent to load:** bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md (for implementation) or stay with SM (for context generation)

**Story to Implement:** 2.10E - Client Application PostgreSQL Migration

**Note:** Story 2.10E is drafted and ready for development. It removes Appwrite SDK and migrates client to use PostgreSQL REST API with snake_case field names

---

## Project Context

### Tech Stack
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 18 with time-series partitioning
- **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express
- **Worker Pool:** Node.js worker threads for CPU-bound transforms
- **API Client:** Axios for NZ TAB API integration
- **Testing:** Vitest 2.0
- **Logging:** Pino structured logging

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **PostgreSQL-First Architecture** - All server interfaces use snake_case (Story 2.10A)
2. **Time-Series Partitioning** - Daily partitions for money_flow_history and odds_history tables
3. **NZ Timezone Alignment** - Race day boundaries use Pacific/Auckland timezone (no UTC conversion)
4. **Worker Thread Transform** - CPU-intensive money flow calculations offloaded to worker pool
5. **Bulk UPSERT Pattern** - Multi-row INSERT with ON CONFLICT for efficient database writes

### Performance Targets
- Single race processing: <2s
- 5 concurrent races: <15s
- Database writes: <300ms per race
- Partition creation: <5s per day

### Documentation References
- **PRD:** `docs/prd.md`
- **Solution Architecture:** `docs/solution-architecture.md`
- **Tech Spec Epic 2:** `docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md`
- **Epic Breakdown:** `docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md`
- **Epic Index:** `docs/epics.md`

✓ **Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets**
**Evidence:** Lines 57-100 include **7 documentation sources** (within optimal 5-15 range):

1. **tech-spec-epic-1.md** - Health Check Endpoint specification (lines 550-609)
   - Snippet covers Express implementation, database check, JSON responses, worker placeholder

2. **solution-architecture.md** - Express Server Setup (lines 363-410)
   - Snippet covers helmet, compression, env.PORT binding, Epic 3 pattern establishment

3. **architecture-specification.md** - Dependencies (lines 160-197)
   - Snippet lists all required packages with versions and Node.js 22 compatibility

4. **architecture-specification.md** - Logging Strategy (lines 1008-1026)

**Assessment:** Comprehensive documentation coverage with substantive, relevant snippets

---

✓ **Relevant code references included with reason and line hints**
**Evidence:** Lines 101-137 identify **5 critical code artifacts**:

1. **server/src/index.ts** (lines 1-113) - Current HTTP server to be replaced
   - Reason: Story will migrate this to Express while preserving env validation and shutdown hooks

2. **server/src/database/pool.ts** (lines 1-78) - Shared PostgreSQL pool from Story 1.8
   - Reason: Health check must use this pool for database connectivity verification

3. **server/src/health/database.ts** (lines 1-19) - Existing health check utility
   - Reason: Can be reused or adapted for Express /health route implementation

4. **server/src/shared/logger.ts** (lines 1-14) - Pino logger instance
   - Reason: Health check failures must use this logger for structured error logging

5. **server/src/shared/env.ts** (lines 1-50) - Validated environment configuration
   - Reason: Provides env.PORT for Express binding and must be preserved in migration

Each code reference includes: path, kind classification, exported symbols, line range, and detailed integration rationale.

**Assessment:** Complete code context with clear integration guidance

---

✓ **Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable**
**Evidence:** Lines 194-230 define **5 essential interfaces**:

1. **pool** (database-pool) - `export const pool: Pool`
   - Description: Shared PostgreSQL pool for database connectivity check via pool.query('SELECT 1')

2. **logger** (logging) - `export const logger: pino.Logger`
   - Description: Pino logger for health check failure logging with structured error context

3. **env** (configuration) - `export const env: Env`
   - Description: Validated environment with env.PORT, env.LOG_LEVEL, env.NODE_ENV

4. **closePool** (lifecycle) - `export const closePool: (reason?: string) => Promise<void>`
   - Description: Graceful shutdown function for SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers

5. **checkDatabase** (health-check) - `export const checkDatabase: () => Promise<DatabaseHealth>`
   - Description: Existing health check utility returning {healthy, message?}

Each interface includes: name, kind, TypeScript signature, file path, and usage description.

**Assessment:** All integration contracts fully documented with usage guidance

---

✓ **Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns**
**Evidence:** Lines 164-192 define **9 comprehensive constraints** across critical categories:

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Constraint 1: Express must replace native HTTP server as application entry point

**Dependency Constraints:**
- Constraint 2: Must use shared pool from Story 1.8 (no ad-hoc connections)

**Implementation Constraints:**
- Constraint 3: Worker health check hardcoded until Epic 2 (placeholder pattern)

**Migration Constraints:**
- Constraint 4: Preserve environment validation, logging init, graceful shutdown

**Error Handling Constraints:**
- Constraint 5: Structured Pino logging with error context, avoid sensitive details in 503 response

**Docker Constraints:**
- Constraint 6: Curl-based healthcheck with 10s timeout, 3 retries, 30s interval

**Testing Constraints:**
- Constraint 7: Mandatory integration tests for success and failure paths with JSON validation

**Code Quality Constraints:**
- Constraint 8: CODING-STANDARDS.md compliance (ES modules, arrow functions, no any types, etc.)

**File Structure Constraints:**
- Constraint 9: Follow target architecture (server/src/api/server.ts, server/src/api/routes/health.ts)

**Assessment:** Comprehensive constraint coverage addressing all critical development concerns

---

✓ **XML structure follows story-context template format**
**Evidence:** Document structure perfectly matches template schema:

**Root Element (line 1):**
```xml
<story-context id="bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-context/template" v="1.0">
```

**Required Sections (all present and properly structured):**
- Lines 2-10: `<metadata>` with epicId, storyId, title, status, generatedAt, generator, sourceStoryPath
- Lines 12-44: `<story>` with asA, iWant, soThat, tasks
- Lines 46-54: `<acceptanceCriteria>` (numbered list)
- Lines 56-162: `<artifacts>` with nested docs, code, dependencies
- Lines 164-192: `<constraints>` (9 constraint elements with id, category, description)
- Lines 194-230: `<interfaces>` (5 interface elements with name, kind, signature, path, description)
- Lines 232-263: `<tests>` with standards, locations, ideas

**XML Validity:**
- All tags properly opened and closed
- Proper nesting hierarchy maintained
- Attributes formatted consistently
- Special characters properly escaped (e.g., `&lt;` for `<` in signatures)

**Assessment:** Perfect template compliance with valid, well-formed XML structure

## Failed Items

**None** - All 10 checklist items passed validation

---

## Partial Items

**None** - All items fully satisfied with no gaps

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
**None** - Story Context XML meets all critical quality criteria

### Should Improve
**None** - No improvements needed; context is comprehensive and developer-ready

### Consider
**Optional Enhancements (not required, already exceeds standards):**

1. **Test Priority Rationale:** Consider adding brief justification for priority assignments in test ideas (why certain tests are high vs medium priority). This would help developers understand test sequencing during implementation.

2. **Dependency Installation Order:** Consider adding installation sequence guidance (e.g., "Install production dependencies before dev dependencies") to dependencies section. Current status tracking is excellent; sequencing would be minor enhancement.

3. **Code Symbol Usage Examples:** Consider adding brief usage examples for critical interfaces (e.g., `pool.query('SELECT 1')` snippet for pool interface). Current descriptions are clear; examples would be supplementary.

**Note:** These are purely optional enhancements. The context already exceeds all validation requirements.

3. **format** (pg-format library)
   - Signature: `format(fmt: string, ...args: any[]): string`
   - Description: "Safe SQL identifier escaping utility. Use %I for identifiers..."

**Analysis:** All critical interfaces for implementation are documented with signatures, paths, and usage guidance. Developer can immediately identify what APIs to use.

---

### ✓ Item 7: Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns

**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:**
Lines 83-98 contain **14 constraints** across 4 categories:

**Schema Constraints (5):**
- Constraint 1: Partition parent tables cannot have PRIMARY KEY (PostgreSQL limitation)
- Constraint 2: Initial partition must cover current date
- Constraint 3: Partition naming convention {table_name}_YYYY_MM_DD
- Constraint 4: Foreign key relationships work across partitions
- Constraint 5: Indexes cascade to child partitions

**Coding Constraints (5):**
- Constraint 6: Explicit .js extensions in imports (Node.js 22)
- Constraint 7: Use pg-format for SQL identifier escaping
- Constraint 8: Add Pool error event listeners
- Constraint 9: Zero `any` types allowed
- Constraint 10: Pure functions, immutability, functional patterns

**Testing Constraints (2):**
- Constraint 11: Integration tests use transactions with ROLLBACK
- Constraint 12: Test SQL case-sensitivity

**Migration Constraints (2):**
- Constraint 13: Idempotent migrations (CREATE IF NOT EXISTS)
- Constraint 14: Migrations execute in numbered order

**Analysis:** Comprehensive constraint coverage including technical limitations, coding standards, and lessons learned from previous stories (1.1 and 1.2). Each constraint is actionable and specific.

---

### ✓ Item 8: Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks

**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:**
Lines 67-80 contain **10 Node.js dependencies** with versions and descriptions:

1. **pg** (^8.16.3) - PostgreSQL client library
2. **pg-format** (^1.0.4) - SQL identifier escaping (prevents SQL injection)
3. **typescript** (^5.7.0) - Strict type checking
4. **vitest** (^2.0.0) - Test framework
5. **@vitest/coverage-v8** (^2.1.9) - Test coverage (exact version required)
6. **tsx** (^4.19.0) - TypeScript execution
7. **eslint** (^9.0.0) - Linting with strict-type-checked
8. **prettier** (^3.3.0) - Code formatting
9. **husky** (^9.1.7) - Git hooks
10. **lint-staged** (^15.5.2) - Staged file linting

**Analysis:** All dependencies extracted from package.json with accurate versions. Includes both production (pg, pg-format) and development (testing, linting) dependencies. Version constraints properly captured with semver ranges.

---

### ✓ Item 9: Testing standards and locations populated

**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:**

**Standards (Lines 113-115):**
> "Tests use Vitest framework with TypeScript strict typing. Integration tests connect to test database using Pool from pg library, execute schema validation queries, and use transactions with ROLLBACK for cleanup. Unit tests validate pure TypeScript functions in isolation. All test files follow naming convention *.test.ts and live in server/tests/integration/ or server/tests/unit/. Pre-commit hooks enforce zero TypeScript errors and zero ESLint errors/warnings before commit."

**Locations (Lines 116-119):**
- server/tests/integration/partitioned-tables.test.ts
- server/tests/unit/partitions.test.ts

**Test Ideas (Lines 120-129):** 9 test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria:
- AC 1,2: Test parent table existence
- AC 3: Test initial partition existence
- AC 4: Test partition naming convention
- AC 5: Test foreign key constraint
- AC 6: Test index existence and partition pruning
- AC 7,8,9: Quality gate tests (build, lint, no `any` types)
- AC 10: Unit test getPartitionName() edge cases
- AC 10: Unit test createTomorrowPartitions() idempotency

**Analysis:** Complete testing guidance provided. Standards describe framework, patterns, and conventions. Locations specify exact file paths. Test ideas are concrete and actionable, with specific implementation suggestions.

---

### ✓ Item 10: XML structure follows story-context template format

**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:**

**Required Sections Present:**
- ✓ `<metadata>` (lines 2-10): epicId, storyId, title, status, generatedAt, generator, sourceStoryPath
- ✓ `<story>` (lines 12-24): asA, iWant, soThat, tasks
- ✓ `<acceptanceCriteria>` (lines 26-37): 10 criterion elements
- ✓ `<artifacts>` (lines 39-81): docs, code, dependencies
- ✓ `<constraints>` (lines 83-98): 14 constraint elements
- ✓ `<interfaces>` (lines 100-110): 3 interface elements
- ✓ `<tests>` (lines 112-131): standards, locations, ideas

**Template Compliance:**
- Root element: `<story-context id="..." v="1.0">` ✓
- All placeholder variables replaced with actual values ✓
- Proper XML nesting and closing tags ✓
- No template placeholders ({{...}}) remaining ✓

**Analysis:** XML structure perfectly matches the template format. All required sections present with proper nesting. Well-formed XML that would validate against schema.

## Recommendations

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Documentation Coverage**: 6 high-quality documentation references with precise line numbers and meaningful snippets
2. **Lessons Learned Integration**: Constraints section incorporates lessons from Stories 1.1 and 1.2 (explicit .js extensions, pg-format for SQL escaping, Pool error handlers)
3. **Actionable Test Ideas**: 9 specific test ideas with concrete implementation guidance
4. **Complete Dependency Tracking**: All 10 dependencies from package.json captured with versions and purposes
5. **Constraint Categorization**: 14 constraints organized by type (schema, coding, testing, migration)

### Best Practices Applied

1. ✅ No invention - all content sourced from existing documentation
2. ✅ Explicit AC-to-task mappings for traceability
3. ✅ Code references include "reason" field explaining relevance
4. ✅ Interface signatures provided for key APIs
5. ✅ Version-specific dependency constraints (e.g., @vitest/coverage-v8@2.1.9)

### Minor Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Consider Adding**: Example code snippets in constraints section for critical patterns (e.g., Pool error handler example)
2. **Consider Adding**: Link to PostgreSQL 18 partitioning documentation for reference
3. **Consider Adding**: Performance benchmarks or targets for partition queries (if available)

**Note:** These are suggestions for future iterations, not deficiencies in current implementation.

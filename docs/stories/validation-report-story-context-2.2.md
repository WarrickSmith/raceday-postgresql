**Document:** /home/warrick/Dev/raceday-postgresql/docs/story-context-2.2.xml
**Checklist:** /home/warrick/Dev/raceday-postgresql/bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-context/checklist.md
**Date:** 2025-10-10T13:50:00Z

## Summary

**Overall:** 10/10 passed (100%)
**Critical Issues:** 0

## Validation Results

### ✓ PASS - Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
**Evidence:** Lines 13-15 contain complete user story fields:
- asA: "backend developer"
- iWant: "comprehensive Zod schemas and TypeScript types for all NZ TAB API response shapes"
- soThat: "the pipeline validates external data at runtime and ensures type-safe data flow with zero `any` types"

### ✓ PASS - Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
**Evidence:** Lines 27-35 contain 8 acceptance criteria matching story-2.2.md lines 13-20 verbatim. All criteria extracted from source story without additions or modifications.

### ✓ PASS - Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
**Evidence:** Lines 16-24 contain 7 tasks extracted from story's Tasks/Subtasks section, maintaining original intent and structure.

### ✓ PASS - Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
**Evidence:** Lines 39-57 contain 6 documentation artifacts:
1. CODING-STANDARDS.md (TypeScript/Zod validation standards)
2. tech-spec-epic-2.md (RaceDataSchema specification)
3. PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md (NFR009 validation requirement)
4. server-old/database-setup/src/database-setup.js (Appwrite legacy schema)
5. docs/api/nztab-openapi.json (NZ TAB API contract)
6. docs/research-findings-nztab-api.md (API research)

All include path, title, section, and relevant snippet. Count within 5-15 range.

### ✓ PASS - Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
**Evidence:** Lines 59-74 contain 5 code artifacts with path, kind, symbol, lines, and explanatory reason:
1. RaceDataSchema (existing schema from Story 2.1)
2. RaceData type (type inference pattern)
3. fetchRaceData (validation integration point)
4. envSchema (reference pattern for z.object)
5. RaceDataSchema validation tests (test patterns)

Each artifact includes specific line ranges and clear relevance explanation.

### ✓ PASS - Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
**Evidence:** Lines 94-106 contain 4 Zod interface definitions:
- z.object (schema builder)
- z.infer (type extraction)
- schema.parse (validation with throws)
- schema.safeParse (validation with result)

All include name, kind, signature, and path. Directly applicable to story requirements.

### ✓ PASS - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
**Evidence:** Lines 86-92 contain 6 development constraints:
- .passthrough() requirement
- Zero any types enforcement
- Field naming alignment with Appwrite
- ESM import syntax
- Structured logging for validation errors
- Module placement guidance

All constraints extracted from Dev Notes and architecture docs, no invention.

### ✓ PASS - Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
**Evidence:** Lines 76-82 contain Node.js dependencies with versions:
- zod ^3.25.76
- typescript ^5.7.0
- vitest ^2.0.0
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin ^8.0.0

All critical dependencies for schema validation and testing correctly identified.

### ✓ PASS - Testing standards and locations populated
**Evidence:**
- Lines 109-110: Testing standards paragraph describing Vitest, test patterns, and pass requirements
- Lines 112-114: Test locations with specific new file and directory paths
- Lines 116-123: Six test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria (AC 1,3,4,6,7,8) with descriptions

Comprehensive testing guidance provided.

### ✓ PASS - XML structure follows story-context template format
**Evidence:** Lines 1-125 follow exact template structure from context-template.xml:
- metadata section (lines 2-10)
- story section (lines 12-25)
- acceptanceCriteria section (lines 27-36)
- artifacts section with docs/code/dependencies (lines 38-84)
- constraints section (lines 86-93)
- interfaces section (lines 94-107)
- tests section with standards/locations/ideas (lines 108-124)

All required elements present and properly nested.

## Assessment

The story context XML is **COMPLETE** and **PRODUCTION-READY**. All checklist items satisfied with comprehensive evidence.

### Strengths
- Complete traceability to source story (no invented requirements)
- Rich documentation artifacts covering all key sources
- Practical code references with specific line numbers
- Clear development constraints and interface contracts
- Actionable test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria
- Perfect XML structure compliance

### Quality Indicators
- 6 documentation artifacts (optimal range)
- 5 code artifacts with clear relevance
- 6 development constraints
- 4 interface definitions
- 6 test ideas covering all critical ACs
- All dependencies with version information

## Recommendations

**None required** - The context is ready for developer consumption.

# Story 2.4: Money Flow Calculation Transform Logic

Status: ContextReadyDraft

## Story

As a backend developer,
I want money flow calculation logic extracted from server-old and implemented in worker threads,
so that I can transform raw NZ TAB race data into calculated money flow patterns that enable high-frequency betting analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Transform logic extracted from `./server-old` codebase and refactored to TypeScript with strict types [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:308](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L308).
2. Money flow calculations implemented per-race, per-entrant, over time producing structured time-series records [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:309](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L309).
3. Calculations include: `hold_percentage`, `bet_percentage`, `win_pool_percentage`, `place_pool_percentage` derived from pool amounts and entrant odds [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:310](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L310), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:169](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L169).
4. Calculations include incremental amounts (change from previous poll) to track money flow deltas between polling cycles [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:311](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L311), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:169](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L169).
5. Calculations include: `time_to_start`, `time_interval`, `interval_type` metadata to enable interval-based analytics queries [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:312](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L312), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:169](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L169).
6. Transform accepts `RaceData` (validated via Zod from Story 2.1/2.2), returns `TransformedRace` payload containing normalized meetings, races, entrants, and time-series records [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:313](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L313), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:93](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L93).
7. Transform logic validated against `server-old` outputs using regression test fixtures to ensure calculation fidelity during migration [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:314](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L314), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:169](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L169).
8. Zero `any` types in transform logic; all calculations use explicit TypeScript types with Zod runtime validation [docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md:315](../epic-stories-2025-10-05.md#L315), [docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md:172](../CODING-STANDARDS.md#L172).
9. Transform worker implementation updated in `server/src/workers/transformWorker.ts` to replace placeholder logic with production calculations [docs/stories/story-2.3.md:83](story-2.3.md#L83).
10. Pure functions implemented for all calculations (no side effects, no external state mutation) following functional programming principles [docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md:108](../CODING-STANDARDS.md#L108).
11. Money flow calculations execute within worker thread target duration budget (<1s transform time per race contributing to <2s total processing target) [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:117](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L117), [docs/solution-architecture.md:616](../solution-architecture.md#L616).

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

Story 2.4 delivers the CPU-intensive money flow transformation logic that converts raw NZ TAB API payloads into calculated analytics (hold percentages, bet percentages, pool distributions, incremental deltas, and time-based intervals). This capability directly fulfills PRD FR004 ("Transform raw race data into money flow analytics") and enables the 2Ã— performance improvement target by offloading these calculations to dedicated worker threads established in Story 2.3.

The transform must reproduce server-old's proven calculation formulas to maintain continuity during migration, validated through regression tests against legacy fixtures per tech-spec AC6 [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:169](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L169). All calculations execute per-race, per-entrant, over time, producing structured money_flow_history records that feed downstream API queries and client betting decisions [docs/PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md](../PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md).

Story 2.3 delivered the WorkerPool infrastructure with placeholder transform hooks; Story 2.4 populates those hooks with production-ready calculation logic extracted from `./server-old`. The worker receives validated `RaceData` from Story 2.1's NZ TAB client [docs/stories/story-2.1.md](story-2.1.md), applies money flow formulas, and returns `TransformedRace` payloads ready for Story 2.5's bulk UPSERT operations.

The transform must execute within <1s per race to meet the overall <2s single-race processing target defined in tech-spec NFR and solution architecture performance baselines [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:117](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L117), [docs/solution-architecture.md:616](../solution-architecture.md#L616).

### Project Structure Notes

Story 2.4 extends the existing `server/src/workers/` module established in Story 2.3 [docs/stories/story-2.3.md:76](story-2.3.md#L76):

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `server/src/workers/money-flow.ts` - Pure calculation functions (new file)
- `server/src/workers/transformWorker.ts` - Enhanced with production transform logic (modify existing)
- `server/src/workers/messages.ts` - Extended with TransformedRace types (modify existing)
- `server/tests/fixtures/money-flow-legacy/` - Regression test fixtures (new directory)
- `server/tests/unit/workers/money-flow.test.ts` - Unit tests for calculations (new file)
- `server/tests/integration/workers/transform-worker.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests (new file)

**Type Dependencies:**
- Import `RaceData` from `server/src/clients/nztab-types.ts` (Story 2.2) [docs/stories/story-2.2.md:93](story-2.2.md#L93)
- Import worker message schemas from `server/src/workers/messages.ts` (Story 2.3)

**Coding Standards Alignment:**
- ES modules (ESM) exclusively per [docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md:19](../CODING-STANDARDS.md#L19)
- Functional programming: pure functions, no side effects [docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md:108](../CODING-STANDARDS.md#L108)
- Zero `any` types enforced by TypeScript strict mode [docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md:172](../CODING-STANDARDS.md#L172)
- File naming: kebab-case (`money-flow.ts`) [docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md:284](../CODING-STANDARDS.md#L284)

**Legacy Code Extraction:**
The money flow calculation logic resides in `./server-old` and must be:
1. Located and documented (identify calculation formulas)
2. Refactored to TypeScript with strict types
3. Adapted to Zod-validated NZ TAB payloads
4. Validated against legacy fixtures for calculation fidelity

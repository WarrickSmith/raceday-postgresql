### Review Checklist
Pass Rate: 16/17 (94%)

✓ Story file loaded from `docs/stories/story-1.7.md`
Evidence: Reviewed full document including status and review section (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:1-280`).

✓ Story Status verified as one of: Ready for Review / Review
Evidence: Status is recorded as "Ready for Review" (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:3`).

✓ Epic and Story IDs resolved (1.7)
Evidence: Story header and context confirm epic 1, story 7 (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:1`, `docs/story-context-1.7.xml:4-10`).

✓ Story Context located or warning recorded
Evidence: Context reference loaded successfully (`docs/story-context-1.7.xml:1-140`).

✓ Epic Tech Spec located or warning recorded
Evidence: Reviewed `docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md` for logging requirements (`docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:443-486`).

✓ Architecture/standards docs loaded (as available)
Evidence: Loaded coding standards guidance (`docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md:1-517`).

✓ Tech stack detected and documented
Evidence: Review notes capture Node.js/TypeScript + Pino stack (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:275-278`).

⚠ MCP doc search performed (or web fallback) and references captured
Evidence: Network access is restricted in this environment, so external MCP/web searches could not run; relied on internal tech spec and coding standards.

✓ Acceptance Criteria cross-checked against implementation
Evidence: Review section maps AC coverage and gap (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:262-264`).

✓ File List reviewed and validated for completeness
Evidence: File List compared with repository status (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:220-231`, `git status`).

✓ Tests identified and mapped to ACs; gaps noted
Evidence: Review highlights missing coverage in logger tests (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:266-268`).

✓ Code quality review performed on changed files
Evidence: Findings reference `server/src/shared/logger.ts` and test suite analysis (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:256-281`).

✓ Security review performed on changed files and dependencies
Evidence: Review confirms no new security issues found (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:272-273`).

✓ Outcome decided (Approve/Changes Requested/Blocked)
Evidence: Outcome recorded as "Changes Requested" (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:253-254`).

✓ Review notes appended under "Senior Developer Review (AI)"
Evidence: Section appended to story (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:245-281`).

✓ Change Log updated with review entry
Evidence: New Change Log entry added (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:242-244`).

➖ Status updated according to settings (if enabled)
Evidence: Workflow setting `update_status_on_result` is false, so no status change required (`bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/review-story/workflow.yaml:45-49`).

✓ Story saved successfully
Evidence: Story file updated with review content (`docs/stories/story-1.7.md:235-281`).

## Failed Items
_None_

## Partial Items
- ⚠ MCP doc search performed (or web fallback) and references captured
  Impact: Review currently relies on internal documentation; capture external best-practice references once network/MCP access is available.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: Re-run documentation search when MCP or web access is available to capture any new logging advisories.
3. Consider: None.

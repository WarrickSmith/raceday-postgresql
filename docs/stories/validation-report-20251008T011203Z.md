### Senior Developer Review - Validation Checklist
Pass Rate: 18/18 (100%)

[✓ PASS] Story file loaded from story_path
Evidence: Story content reviewed directly (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:1-40`).

[✓ PASS] Story Status verified as one of the allowed values
Evidence: Status remains `Ready for Review` in header (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:3`).

[✓ PASS] Epic and Story IDs resolved (epic 1, story 8)
Evidence: Filename and context confirm IDs (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:1`, `docs/story-context-1.8.xml:3-4`).

[✓ PASS] Story Context located or warning recorded
Evidence: Dev Agent Record lists `docs/story-context-1.8.xml`; file loaded and reviewed (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:85-99`, `docs/story-context-1.8.xml:1-80`).

[✓ PASS] Epic Tech Spec located or warning recorded
Evidence: Tech spec `docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md` loaded fully; references cited in review findings (`docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md:489-560`).

[✓ PASS] Architecture/standards docs loaded (as available)
Evidence: Verified expected filenames under `docs/` (none present) via shell listing; recorded observation in review (command output `ls docs/{prd.md,...}` showing missing files).

[✓ PASS] Tech stack detected and documented
Evidence: Server manifest confirms Node + pg stack (`server/package.json:1-54`).

[✓ PASS] MCP doc search performed (or web fallback) and references captured
Evidence: Fetched Node.js HTTP shutdown guidance and node-postgres pooling docs via web fallback (`curl https://nodejs.org/api/http.html`, `curl https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting`); citations included in review notes.

[✓ PASS] Acceptance Criteria cross-checked against implementation
Evidence: Review section details AC coverage with code references (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:213-220`, `server/src/database/pool.ts:6-27`, `server/src/index.ts:5-84`).

[✓ PASS] File List reviewed and validated for completeness
Evidence: File list section audited against repository contents (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:159-173`).

[✓ PASS] Tests identified and mapped to ACs; gaps noted
Evidence: Testing status and new test files documented (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:153-166`, `server/tests/unit/database/pool.test.ts`, `server/tests/integration/database-pool.test.ts`).

[✓ PASS] Code quality review performed on changed files
Evidence: Key findings recorded in review outlining shutdown bug and listener accumulation (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:206-212`).

[✓ PASS] Security review performed on changed files and dependencies
Evidence: Security notes section confirms no new exposures (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:231-233`).

[✓ PASS] Outcome decided (Approve/Changes Requested/Blocked)
Evidence: Outcome marked as `Changes Requested` in review section (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:203-205`).

[✓ PASS] Review notes appended under "Senior Developer Review (AI)"
Evidence: New section appended with full review narrative (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:195-240`).

[✓ PASS] Change Log updated with review entry
Evidence: Change Log records review addition (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md:191-193`).

[✓ PASS] Status updated according to settings (if enabled)
Evidence: Workflow configuration keeps `update_status_on_result` false; status correctly left as `Ready for Review` (`bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/review-story/workflow.yaml`, `docs/stories/story-1.8.md:3`).

[✓ PASS] Story saved successfully
Evidence: Story file contains appended review content with latest timestamp; git diff reflects saved changes (`docs/stories/story-1.8.md`).

## Failed Items
None.

## Partial Items
None.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: Address the shutdown sequencing and listener guard action items captured in the review (`server/src/index.ts`, `server/src/database/pool.ts`).
3. Consider: Document Postgres dependency for integration tests alongside new pooling coverage.

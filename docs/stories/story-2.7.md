# Story 2.7: Race Processor Orchestrator

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a developer,
I want a race processor that orchestrates the fetch → transform → write pipeline,
so that I can process a complete race in <2s end-to-end with structured error handling and performance tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Deliver `processRace(raceId: string)` function that coordinates the complete pipeline and returns `ProcessResult` with timings and status [[docs/epics.md:66](../epics.md#L66), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:98](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L98)]
2. Execute pipeline steps sequentially: fetch → transform (worker) → write (bulk UPSERT + time-series) [[docs/epics.md:67](../epics.md#L67), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:106-108](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L106)]
3. Each step awaited before proceeding to next; no parallel execution within a single race [[docs/epics.md:68](../epics.md#L68)]
4. Track and return durations for: fetch_ms, transform_ms, write_ms, total_ms [[docs/epics.md:69](../epics.md#L69), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:174](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L174)]
5. Retry fetch failures according to Story 2.12 retry policy; null fetch results short-circuit pipeline [[docs/epics.md:70](../epics.md#L70), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:176](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L176)]
6. Log transform errors with structured context; surface typed errors to caller [[docs/epics.md:70](../epics.md#L70)]
7. Rollback database writes on failure; maintain transaction integrity [[docs/epics.md:70](../epics.md#L70), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:129](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L129)]
8. Emit structured logs for: pipeline start, each step completion, pipeline end [[docs/epics.md:71](../epics.md#L71), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:133-135](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L133)]
9. Return processing duration for metrics aggregation by scheduler [[docs/epics.md:72](../epics.md#L72)]
10. Achieve <2s total processing time under nominal load (single race, fresh data) [[docs/epics.md:73](../epics.md#L73), [docs/PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md:169](../PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md#L169)]

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

- Story 2.7 defines the orchestrator that composes fetch, transform, and write stages into a cohesive pipeline with sub-2s latency [[docs/epics.md:59-73](../epics.md#L59)]
- Tech spec mandates sequential execution with performance tracking at each boundary and structured error handling [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:98-99](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L98), [docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:174](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L174)]
- PRD performance target: <2s per race is critical to achieve the 2× improvement goal [[docs/PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md:169](../PRD-raceday-postgresql-2025-10-05.md#L169)]
- Solution architecture places race processor as the central coordinator between scheduler and database operations [[docs/solution-architecture.md:310-335](../solution-architecture.md#L310)]

### Architecture & Constraints

- Sequential pipeline execution ensures clear timing attribution and simplifies debugging [[docs/epics.md:68](../epics.md#L68)]
- Null fetch responses (from retry exhaustion) should gracefully skip downstream processing without throwing [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:176](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L176)]
- Database writes must execute within single transaction for rollback integrity [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:129](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L129)]
- All timing measurements use `performance.now()` for microsecond precision [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:174](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L174)]
- Emit warning logs when total_ms ≥ 2000ms to feed performance monitoring pipeline [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:179](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L179)]
- Reuse existing Pino logger with structured fields (raceId, stage, duration) [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:133-135](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L133)]

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests mock fetch/transform/write dependencies to verify orchestration logic, timing calculations, and error handling [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:215](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L215)]
- Integration tests execute full pipeline against test database with seeded data, measuring actual timings [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:180](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L180)]
- Performance test validates <2s target with realistic race payloads (Story 2.13 dependency) [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:180](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L180)]
- Error injection tests verify rollback behavior and connection cleanup on failures [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:129](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L129)]

### Project Structure Notes

- Create `server/src/pipeline/race-processor.ts` as main orchestrator module [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:98](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L98)]
- Depends on: `fetchRaceData` (Story 2.1), worker pool (Story 2.3), bulk UPSERT (Story 2.5), time-series inserts (Story 2.6)
- Exports `processRace` function and `ProcessResult` type for scheduler integration (Story 2.9) [[docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:98-99](../tech-spec-epic-2.md#L98)]
- Place unit tests under `server/tests/unit/pipeline/`
- Place integration tests under `server/tests/integration/pipeline/` (reuse from Story 2.13)

### Debug Log References

- 2025-10-13 – create-story workflow executed (Scrum Master)

### Debug Log

- 2025-10-13 14:30 NZT – Plan for "Implement core race processor module": 1) reshape `processRace` to accept `raceId` and drive fetch → transform → write sequentially with typed stage errors (`FetchError`, `TransformError`, `WriteError`) mapped to AC1-3 & AC6-7; 2) add `performance.now()` instrumentation and structured logs for pipeline start, per-stage completion, and end including fetch_ms/transform_ms/write_ms/total_ms + warning threshold at 2000 ms (AC4, AC8-9); 3) handle null fetch short-circuit per Story 2.12 policy, wrap write stage to log rollback context, and ensure dependencies release resources on every exit path (AC5, AC7).
- 2025-10-13 15:05 NZT – Implemented orchestration flow in `server/src/pipeline/race-processor.ts` with sequential fetch/transform/write stages, `ProcessResult` timing metrics, structured logging, and typed stage errors; verified AC1-9 via new unit tests and mock-backed integration batch coverage (tests: `vitest run tests/unit/pipeline/race-processor.test.ts tests/integration/pipeline/race-processor.integration.test.ts`).
- 2025-10-13 15:10 NZT – Blocked on AC10 integration coverage requiring seeded PostgreSQL test database; current integration suite uses mocked persistence to validate batching and error surfacing, but real DB rollback/perf assertions remain outstanding pending environment.
- 2025-10-13 15:41 NZT – Provisioned partitions on dev PostgreSQL and added real DB integration specs covering <2s SLA and rollback on partition miss; pipeline now exercises actual UPSERT + time-series writers. Test command: `npm --prefix server run test -- run tests/unit/pipeline/race-processor.test.ts tests/integration/pipeline/race-processor.integration.test.ts`.
- 2025-10-13 15:55 NZT – Resolved ESLint (naming/destructuring) and TypeScript strictness issues; validated clean lint/build with `npm --prefix server run lint` and `npm --prefix server run build` ahead of final test run.
- 2025-10-14 10:00 NZT – Plan for Action Item 1 (extract odds utilities): 1) introduce `server/src/pipeline/odds-utils.ts` exporting `resolveOddsEventTimestamp` and `buildOddsRecords`; 2) refactor `race-processor.ts` to import helpers and remove inline implementations; 3) update existing unit/integration tests if mocks require adjustment; 4) ensure exports remain tree-shake friendly for future reuse.
- 2025-10-14 10:18 NZT – Completed Action Item 1: extracted odds helper utilities into `server/src/pipeline/odds-utils.ts`, refactored orchestrator imports, and added dedicated unit coverage validating timestamp resolution fallbacks.
- 2025-10-14 10:05 NZT – Plan for Action Item 2 (add JSDoc to public exports): 1) annotate `ProcessResult`, `ProcessTimings`, `ProcessRowCounts`, and error classes with concise JSDoc; 2) document `processRace`/`processRaces` behaviors, including timing metrics and error propagation; 3) ensure comments compile cleanly under TypeScript strict mode; 4) avoid redundant commentary on obvious structures.
- 2025-10-14 10:22 NZT – Completed Action Item 2: added targeted JSDoc annotations to pipeline exports and error types, improving IDE context without introducing lint noise.
- 2025-10-14 10:10 NZT – Plan for Action Item 3 (document ProcessErrorType relationship): 1) add inline comment clarifying that `ProcessErrorType` maps directly to pipeline stages; 2) ensure error classes reference the documented type to aid comprehension; 3) avoid duplicating details already covered in acceptance criteria.
- 2025-10-14 10:24 NZT – Completed Action Item 3: documented `ProcessErrorType` linkage to fetch/transform/write stages for quicker onboarding.
- 2025-10-14 10:12 NZT – Plan for Action Item 4 (add processRaces integration test): 1) extend `server/tests/integration/pipeline/race-processor.integration.test.ts` with batch scenario mixing success and induced failure; 2) assert concurrency handling returns fulfilled results plus typed errors; 3) reuse existing fixtures to minimize setup overhead; 4) keep runtime budget <5s.
- 2025-10-14 10:32 NZT – Completed Action Item 4: added mixed batch integration test confirming `processRaces` surfaces successes plus typed write errors while persisting only successful rows.
- 2025-10-14 10:15 NZT – Plan for Action Item 5 (add optional contextId to ProcessResult): 1) extend `ProcessResult` with `contextId?: string` surfaced by `processRace`/`processRaces`; 2) accept optional parameter allowing schedulers to inject correlation IDs; 3) update builders/tests to assert shape without breaking existing callers; 4) document new field in story notes.
- 2025-10-14 10:40 NZT – Completed Action Item 5: introduced `ProcessOptions` with optional `contextId`, wired through result builder/logs, and added unit/integration assertions covering propagation.

### Completion Notes List
- AC1-9 implemented: `processRace` now orchestrates fetch → transform → write with stage timings, sequential awaits, structured logging, and typed error propagation; warnings emit when total_ms ≥ 2000.
- Added unit suite (`server/tests/unit/pipeline/race-processor.test.ts`) covering happy path instrumentation, null fetch short-circuit, transform/write failures, and partition handling; added integration batch test (`server/tests/integration/pipeline/race-processor.integration.test.ts`) validating `processRaces` concurrency/error reporting with mocked persistence.
- AC10 satisfied: real PostgreSQL-backed integration verifies nominal pipeline persists data within <2s target and confirms write-stage rollback behaviour when partitions are missing (no time-series rows created).
- Lint (`npm --prefix server run lint`) and TypeScript build (`npm --prefix server run build`) both clean, ensuring no implicit `any` or formatting regressions in new orchestration/tests.
- Resolved Story 2.7 action items: extracted odds helpers into `server/src/pipeline/odds-utils.ts`, documented pipeline types, added `contextId` support via `ProcessOptions`, and expanded tests (unit + integration) for batch processing.
- Tests executed today: `npm --prefix server run test -- run tests/unit/pipeline/race-processor.test.ts tests/unit/pipeline/odds-utils.test.ts tests/integration/pipeline/race-processor.integration.test.ts` (17 specs, 0 failures, 630 ms).

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** warrick
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story 2.7 delivers a production-ready race processor orchestrator that successfully coordinates the fetch → transform → write pipeline with comprehensive error handling, precise performance instrumentation, and complete test coverage. The implementation demonstrates exemplary engineering discipline with zero ESLint/TypeScript errors, 100% passing tests (10 specs covering all acceptance criteria), and measured performance well within the <2s SLA target (14ms actual in integration tests). All 10 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with traceable implementation and corresponding test coverage.

### Key Findings

**Strengths (High Confidence):**
- **Architecture Fidelity:** Implementation precisely follows tech spec design with sequential pipeline execution, performance.now() instrumentation at each boundary, and structured Pino logging with raceId context throughout [race-processor.ts:298-564]
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Typed error classes (FetchError, TransformError, WriteError) with retryable flags, proper cause chaining, and ProcessResult embedded in errors for full context propagation [race-processor.ts:157-193]
- **Test Excellence:** 8 unit tests with mocked dependencies validate orchestration logic, timing calculations, null fetch short-circuit, and all error paths; 2 integration tests with real PostgreSQL verify <2s SLA and rollback behavior [race-processor.test.ts, race-processor.integration.test.ts]
- **Performance Instrumentation:** Detailed timing breakdown (fetch_ms, transform_ms, write_ms with sub-stage breakdown for meetings/races/entrants/money_flow/odds) plus overBudget warnings at 2000ms threshold [race-processor.ts:538-562]
- **Code Quality:** Clean ESLint/TypeScript build, functional programming patterns, zero `any` types, explicit type annotations on all interfaces, proper resource cleanup patterns

**Observations:**
- Parallel batch processing via `processRaces` function demonstrates concurrency control with maxConcurrency parameter and Promise.allSettled isolation [race-processor.ts:567-651]
- buildOddsRecords helper extracts both fixed_win_odds and pool_win_odds from transformed entrants for odds_history persistence [race-processor.ts:209-234]
- Integration test validates transaction rollback when partition is missing (2035 date triggers PartitionNotFoundError, confirms 0 rows persisted) [race-processor.integration.test.ts:303-320]

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Unit Test Coverage (8 specs):**
- ✅ Sequential execution with mocked dependencies and timing validation [race-processor.test.ts:189-250]
- ✅ Over-budget warning logged when total_ms ≥ 2000ms [race-processor.test.ts:252-284]
- ✅ Null fetch short-circuits without errors [race-processor.test.ts:286-311]
- ✅ Fetch failures wrapped in FetchError with retryable flag [race-processor.test.ts:313-344]
- ✅ Transform failures wrapped in TransformError, stops pipeline [race-processor.test.ts:346-381]
- ✅ Write failures wrapped in WriteError with DatabaseWriteError retryable metadata [race-processor.test.ts:383-427]
- ✅ PartitionNotFoundError treated as non-retryable WriteError [race-processor.test.ts:429-472]
- ✅ TransactionError wrapped as WriteError with retryable=false [race-processor.test.ts:474-510]

**Integration Test Coverage (2 specs):**
- ✅ End-to-end pipeline with real PostgreSQL, <2s SLA validation, row count verification [race-processor.integration.test.ts:266-301]
- ✅ Rollback verification when partition missing (no money_flow/odds_history rows) [race-processor.integration.test.ts:303-320]

**Coverage Gaps:** None identified. All acceptance criteria have corresponding unit or integration tests. Parallel batch processing (`processRaces`) not explicitly tested in this story's suite but validated implicitly through single-race coverage and documented for Story 2.8/2.9 integration.

### Architectural Alignment

**Alignment with Tech Spec (docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md):**
- ✅ Sequential execution pattern matches spec lines 106-108 (fetch → transform → write)
- ✅ Performance tracking implements spec lines 174-180 (performance.now() boundaries, warning logs at 2000ms)
- ✅ Error handling follows spec lines 173-176 (null fetch short-circuit, typed errors, retryable flags)
- ✅ Structured logging aligns with spec lines 133-135 (Pino with raceId, phase, duration)
- ✅ Transaction integrity per spec line 129 (withTransaction wrapper, rollback on failure)

**Alignment with Solution Architecture (docs/solution-architecture.md):**
- ✅ Race Processor as central orchestrator between scheduler and database operations (lines 310-335)
- ✅ Parallelization pattern using Promise.allSettled for batch processing (though primary focus is single-race orchestration)
- ✅ Performance tracking with duration measurement per race (lines 310-335)

**Dependency Integration:**
- ✅ fetchRaceData (Story 2.1): Properly invoked with raceId, NzTabError handling [race-processor.ts:314, 328]
- ✅ workerPool.exec (Story 2.3): Dispatched with RaceData, TransformedRace result consumed [race-processor.ts:410]
- ✅ Bulk UPSERT (Story 2.5): Sequential calls to bulkUpsertMeetings/Races/Entrants [race-processor.ts:241-267]
- ✅ Time-series inserts (Story 2.6): insertMoneyFlowHistory and insertOddsHistory invoked after UPSERT [race-processor.ts:271, 277]

### Security Notes

**No Security Issues Identified.** Implementation follows secure coding practices:
- ✅ No dynamic SQL construction (relies on parameterized queries in bulk-upsert/time-series modules)
- ✅ No secrets logged or exposed (error serialization via serializeError helper redacts sensitive data)
- ✅ Input validation delegated to upstream Zod schemas (fetchRaceData returns validated RaceData)
- ✅ No unsafe type assertions or `any` types (TypeScript strict mode with zero errors)
- ✅ Error messages do not expose internal implementation details (generic messages with cause chaining)

**Observations:**
- serializeError helper safely extracts name/message/stack from Error instances [race-processor.ts:82-92]
- Structured logging includes error objects but Pino serialization handles redaction per logger configuration

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack:** Node.js 22 + TypeScript 5.7 + Express 4.21 + PostgreSQL (pg 8.16) + Pino 9.5 + Vitest 2.0

**Framework Best Practices Applied:**
- ✅ **Node.js 22:** ESM modules (`import/export`), performance.now() for precise timing, async/await without Promise wrapper overhead
- ✅ **TypeScript 5.7:** Strict mode enabled, zero `any` types, discriminated unions for ProcessStatus, functional interfaces over classes
- ✅ **PostgreSQL (pg):** Parameterized queries, connection pooling with automatic release, transaction wrapping via withTransaction helper
- ✅ **Pino Logging:** Structured JSON with consistent field names (raceId, event, timings), child logger pattern for context propagation
- ✅ **Vitest Testing:** Mocking with vi.fn() typed generics, beforeEach cleanup, performance spy for timing validation, integration tests with real DB

**Code Quality Standards:**
- ✅ Functional programming patterns (pure functions, no side effects in helpers, immutable data structures)
- ✅ Single Responsibility: Each function has clear, focused purpose (processRace, persistTransformedRace, buildOddsRecords, createResult)
- ✅ DRY principle: zeroRowCounts factory, createResult builder, serializeError utility eliminate duplication
- ✅ Error handling: Typed error classes with structured metadata, cause chaining for debugging
- ✅ Naming conventions: ESLint naming-convention enforced, snake_case for DB fields, camelCase for JS/TS
- ✅ Documentation: Inline comments explain non-obvious logic (partition miss handling, odds extraction), function signatures self-documenting

### Action Items

**No Critical or High Severity Issues Identified.**

**Medium Severity (Resolved 2025-10-14):**
- ✅ Extracted `resolveOddsEventTimestamp` and `buildOddsRecords` into shared `server/src/pipeline/odds-utils.ts` module for reuse and easier testing.
- ✅ Added JSDoc comments to public exports (`processRace`, `processRaces`, error classes, ProcessResult types) to improve IDE assistance and generated docs.

**Low Severity (Resolved 2025-10-14):**
- ✅ Documented `ProcessErrorType` mapping to pipeline stages via inline comment.
- ✅ Added integration coverage for `processRaces` mixed success/failure batch handling.
- ✅ Introduced optional `contextId` on `ProcessResult` (via `ProcessOptions`) for downstream tracing support.

**Carry-Forward from Previous Stories:**
- **[Low]** Update `buildOddsRecords` to use `transformed.race.start_time_nz` instead of `new Date().toISOString()` fallback for improved data accuracy (Story 2.6 follow-up) - Already noted in [tech-spec-epic-2.md:145](../docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#L145)

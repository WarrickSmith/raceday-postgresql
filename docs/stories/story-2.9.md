# Story 2.9: Daily Baseline Data Initialization

Status: InProgress

## Story

As a **system operator**,
I want **automated daily fetching of meetings, races, and initial race data early in the race day**,
so that **the scheduler has race times available and baseline data is pre-populated before real-time polling begins**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Daily initialization function runs early morning (6:00 AM NZST) before scheduler activates
2. Function fetches all meetings for current NZ race day from NZ TAB API
3. Function fetches all race details (times, entrants, initial odds) for those meetings
4. Function uses NZ timezone fields (race_date_nz, start_time_nz) from API - no UTC conversion needed
5. Function populates database tables: meetings, races (with start_time), entrants (with initial data)
6. Function uses bulk UPSERT operations for efficient data loading
7. Function handles API failures gracefully with retry logic (max 3 retries)
8. Function completes before dynamic scheduler starts (by 7:00 AM NZST)
9. Function logs completion statistics: meetings fetched, races created, entrants populated, execution duration
10. Scheduler queries database for races with start_time >= NOW() to begin polling operations
11. Database queries use race_date_nz field for partition key alignment (NZ racing day boundary)
12. Optional: Second evening job (post-races, e.g., 9:00 PM NZST) for comprehensive historical backfill if needed

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Integration

**Daily Initialization Module (`initialization/daily-baseline.ts`)**

- Runs as scheduled task at 6:00 AM NZST before real-time scheduler starts
- Fetches meetings → races → entrants in sequence
- Populates baseline data using bulk UPSERT operations
- Critical dependency for Story 2.10 (Dynamic Scheduler)

**Key Functions:**

- `runDailyInitialization(): Promise<InitializationResult>` - Main entry point
- `fetchMeetingsForToday(): Promise<Meeting[]>` - Fetch NZ/AU meetings for current NZ day
- `fetchRacesForMeetings(meetings: Meeting[]): Promise<Race[]>` - Fetch race details with start times
- `populateBaselineData(meetings, races, entrants): Promise<void>` - Bulk UPSERT to database
- `logCompletionStatistics(stats: InitStats): void` - Structured logging of results

**Integration Points:**

- Reuses NZ TAB API client from Story 2.1 (with retry logic)
- Reuses bulk UPSERT functions from Story 2.5 (meetings, races, entrants)
- Provides race schedule data for Story 2.10 (Dynamic Scheduler)
- Uses Pino logger from Epic 1.7 for structured logging
- Coordinates with scheduler activation timing

### NZ Timezone Field Usage

**Critical Design Decision:**
The NZ TAB API provides timezone-specific fields that eliminate UTC conversion complexity:

**race_date_nz (YYYY-MM-DD in NZST/NZDT):**

- Used for identifying NZ racing day boundary
- Aligns with partition strategy (partitions by NZ day, not UTC day)
- Example: "2025-10-14" represents Oct 14 in NZ timezone

**start_time_nz (HH:MM:SS NZST format):**

- Local NZ time for race start
- No UTC conversion needed
- Stored directly in database for scheduler queries
- Example: "12:50:00 NZST" for a race starting at 12:50 PM NZ time

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates timezone conversion bugs
- Aligns with business logic (NZ racing day)
- Matches partition strategy (daily partitions by NZ date)
- Simplifies scheduler time-to-start calculations

**Reference:**

- [NZ TAB API Documentation](../api/README.md) - Timezone field details
- [API Sample Response](../api/nztab-samples/race-event-full-response.json:32-33) - race_date_nz and start_time_nz fields

### Performance Requirements

**Initialization Timing:**

- Start: 6:00 AM NZST (scheduled task)
- Completion target: Before 7:00 AM NZST (scheduler activation)
- Max duration: 60 minutes (allows for large racing days with 50+ meetings)

**API Request Volume:**

- Meetings fetch: 1 request (all meetings for day)
- Race details: 1 request per meeting (typically 10-30 meetings)
- Estimated total: 15-35 API requests for typical racing day
- Rate limiting: 500ms delay between race detail requests

**Database Write Performance:**

- Bulk UPSERT meetings: <100ms (typically 10-30 meetings)
- Bulk UPSERT races: <300ms (typically 100-300 races)
- Bulk UPSERT entrants: <500ms (typically 1000-3000 entrants)
- Total write time: <1 second for typical racing day

### Scheduler Dependency

**Critical Integration:**
The dynamic scheduler (Story 2.10) depends on this initialization:

**Without Daily Initialization:**

- Scheduler has no races to schedule (empty races table)
- Cannot calculate time-to-start (no start_time values)
- Cannot determine polling intervals
- Real-time polling cannot begin

**With Daily Initialization:**

- Races table populated with start_time values at 6:00 AM
- Scheduler queries: `SELECT * FROM races WHERE start_time >= NOW()`
- Scheduler calculates time-to-start for each race
- Scheduler applies correct polling intervals (15s, 30s, 60s)
- Real-time polling begins at 7:00 AM

**Query Pattern:**

```typescript
// Scheduler query (Story 2.10) depends on start_time from initialization
const upcomingRaces = await pool.query(`
  SELECT race_id, start_time, status
  FROM races
  WHERE status IN ('open', 'upcoming')
    AND start_time > NOW()
  AND start_time < NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours'
  ORDER BY start_time ASC
`)
```

### Error Handling Strategy

**Graceful Degradation:**

- API failures for individual meetings/races don't block entire initialization
- Partial success is acceptable (e.g., 25 of 30 meetings populated)
- Failed meetings logged for manual investigation
- Scheduler can work with partial data (polls available races)

**Retry Logic:**

- Transient failures (network errors, 5xx responses) retried up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms
- Permanent failures (4xx errors) not retried
- All attempts logged for debugging

**Monitoring and Alerts:**

- Log completion statistics (success rate, failures, duration)
- Warning if initialization takes >30 minutes
- Error if initialization fails completely (no races populated)
- Alert if success rate <90% (indicates API or system issues)

### Structured Logging Examples

**Initialization Started:**

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "msg": "Daily baseline initialization started",
  "nz_date": "2025-10-14",
  "nz_time": "06:00:00 NZST",

}
```

  "total_meetings": 28,
  "nz_meetings": 15,
  "au_meetings": 13,
  "fetch_duration_ms": 450
}
```

**Initialization Completed:**

  "nz_time": "06:03:00 NZST"
}
```

**Partial Failure:**

### Debug Log References

- Plan (Task 1 – Daily scheduler, AC1, AC8):
  1. Inspect server startup flow to understand how `startScheduler()` is invoked so the initialization run can gate dynamic polling.
  2. Add `server/src/initialization/scheduler.ts` backed by `node-cron` to trigger the daily run at 06:00 Pacific/Auckland with a 15-minute safety timeout and structured start/complete/failure logs.
  3. Expose a bootstrap helper that executes the first run on startup and resolves before the dynamic scheduler activation path continues.
- Execution (Task 1 – Daily scheduler, AC1, AC8):
  - Introduced `node-cron` dependency and new `startDailyInitializationScheduler()` that schedules a 06:00 Pacific/Auckland job, wraps runs in a 15-minute timeout, and emits structured start/complete/failure logs.
  - Updated `server/src/index.ts` to bootstrap the daily scheduler at startup, await the first run before calling the dynamic race scheduler, and ensure shutdown stops the cron task cleanly.
- Plan (Task 2 – Meetings fetch, AC2, AC4):
  1. Extend `server/src/clients/nztab.ts` with a `fetchMeetingsForDate()` helper that reuses the existing retry infrastructure, validates with `MeetingDataSchema`, and maps NZ timezone fields without UTC conversion.
  2. Filter results to NZ/AU thoroughbred and harness meetings, capturing `race_date_nz` for downstream partition alignment and logging counts for observability.
  3. Expose a typed wrapper inside `daily-baseline.ts` that pulls the current NZ racing day, invokes the client helper, and returns normalized meeting entities for the bulk upsert stage.
- Execution (Task 2 – Meetings fetch, AC2, AC4):
  - Added a `fetchMeetingsForDate()` client that validates `MeetingDataSchema`, filters to NZ/AU thoroughbred and harness meetings, and logs retry/outcome telemetry.
  - Wired `daily-baseline.ts` to compute the NZ racing day, call the new client helper, transform meetings into the existing bulk upsert shape, and persist them with structured completion stats.
- Plan (Task 3 – Race details fetch, AC3, AC4):
  1. Extend NZ TAB client utilities to gather race IDs per meeting and fetch detailed `/events/{raceId}` payloads with concurrency control to avoid API saturation.
  2. Normalize race metadata (including `race_date_nz`, `start_time_nz`, entrant snapshots) into the existing transform shapes, capturing partial failures for retry/backoff logging.
  3. Surface race-level metrics (fetched vs. failed counts, retry attempts) back through `daily-baseline.ts` so completion stats cover meetings, races, and entrants.
- Execution (Task 3 – Race details fetch, AC3, AC4):
  - Added meeting-aware race fetching that batches `/events/{raceId}` calls (max concurrency 5), logs partial failures, and returns success/error ids for downstream metrics.
  - Updated `daily-baseline.ts` to iterate through meetings, aggregate race payloads, and track fetched/failed race counts in the initialization stats.
- Plan (Task 4 – Database population, AC5, AC6, AC11):
  1. Transform race payloads into normalized meeting/race/entrant structures that reuse the Story 2.5 bulk UPSERT shapes, ensuring `race_date_nz` and cleaned `start_time_nz` are preserved.
  2. Execute `bulkUpsertRaces()` and `bulkUpsertEntrants()` within the initialization flow, capturing row counts and handling partial data (skip empty batches).
  3. Update completion stats and structured logs with meetings/races/entrants writes plus any failures so downstream consumers see partition-aligned counts.
- Execution (Task 4 – Database population, AC5, AC6, AC11):
  - Implemented baseline transformers that normalize race metadata (cleaning `start_time_nz`) and entrants into the Story 2.5 UPSERT shapes while accepting camelCase/snake_case payloads.
  - Wired `daily-baseline.ts` to bulk UPSERT races and entrants when payloads exist, recording row counts and failed race IDs in the completion stats alongside meeting writes.
- Plan (Task 5 – Retry & resilience, AC7):
  1. Track race-level retry attempts and failures so initialization stats expose how many retries occurred across the run.
  2. Ensure partial failures (per-race or per-meeting) bubble up as warnings without aborting the overall initialization, including structured logs and status arrays.
  3. Add exponential backoff helpers when iterating meetings to avoid hammering the API after repeated failures.
- Execution (Task 5 – Retry & resilience, AC7):
  - Counted race-level failures into a retry tally, recorded affected meeting IDs, and surfaced them through the initialization stats/log payloads.
  - Added per-meeting backoff after failures plus structured warn logs so partial API outages don't halt the run yet still leave breadcrumbs for follow-up.
- Plan (Task 6 – Completion metrics, AC9):
  1. Emit structured start/completion logs documenting meetings fetched/written, races created, entrants populated, retries, and duration.
  2. Format stats for JSON logging (Pino) and ensure fail path logs include same metric keys for observability parity.
  3. Prepare helper to expose stats for downstream scheduler validation/tests.
- Execution (Task 6 – Completion metrics, AC9):
  - Completion logs now publish the aggregated stats dictionary (meetings, races, entrants, retries, duration) on both success and failure paths for consistent observability.

### Completion Notes List

- AC1–AC11: Implemented the 6:00 AM NZST daily baseline runner with meeting/race/entrant ingestion, scheduler gating, and partition-aware writes so Story 2.10 has data loaded before activation.
- AC7/AC9: Structured Pino telemetry now captures retries, failed identifiers, and duration on both success and failure paths; per-meeting backoff prevents API thrash during partial outages.
- Testing: All tests passing (293 passed, 8 skipped). No ESLint or TypeScript errors.
- Status: Story updated to Ready for Review on 2025-10-14.
- Follow-up: Task 10 (evening backfill job) remains optional and is not yet implemented.

- Plan (Task 7 – Scheduler integration, AC10):
  1. Confirm dynamic scheduler query already filters on `start_time > NOW()` and relies on races table populated by initialization.
  2. Ensure initialization gating defers scheduler startup until the first run completes and exposes stats needed for runtime checks.
  3. Capture these behaviours in documentation/tests to demonstrate the scheduler reads newly seeded races.
- Execution (Task 7 – Scheduler integration, AC10):
  - Verified the existing scheduler query (`start_time > NOW()`) remains aligned and leveraged the startup gate so the daily job finishes before enabling polling, ensuring integration readiness.
- Plan (Task 8 – Unit tests, AC All):
  1. Mock NZ TAB client and bulk upsert modules to drive `runDailyBaselineInitialization()` through success and partial-failure flows.
  2. Assert stats counters, normalized race times, and retry/failed lists so logic is validated without touching the database.
  3. Cover failure propagation by forcing a race fetch error and verifying retries/backoff bookkeeping.
- Execution (Task 8 – Unit tests, AC All):
  - Added `server/tests/unit/initialization/daily-baseline.test.ts` with mocked NZ TAB client/upsert modules to verify happy path stats and partial failure retries without hitting Postgres.
- Plan (Task 9 – Integration tests, AC All):
  1. Use the real Postgres pool with temporary tables to validate end-to-end writes when mocks supply deterministic NZ TAB responses.
  2. Confirm meetings/races/entrants rows persist with the expected IDs and `start_time_nz`, mirroring scheduler needs.
  3. Query using the scheduler’s SQL predicate to prove initialization supplies data discoverable by the polling loop.
- Execution (Task 9 – Integration tests, AC All):
  - Added `server/tests/integration/initialization/daily-baseline.integration.test.ts` that seeds deterministic API responses, runs the initializer, verifies DB rows, and exercises the scheduler query.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

### Reviewer

warrick

### Date

2025-10-14

### Outcome

Changes Requested

### Summary

Story 2.9 implements a comprehensive daily baseline data initialization system that successfully meets all acceptance criteria in the code and test environment. The implementation provides automated daily fetching of meetings, races, and initial race data at 6:00 AM NZST, populating the database before the dynamic scheduler activates at 7:00 AM NZST. The code demonstrates good architectural patterns, proper error handling, and includes thorough test coverage. However, a runtime issue has been identified where the daily initialization is failing with 500 errors when running `npm run dev`.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

1. **Runtime API Failure**: The daily initialization is failing with 500 errors when running `npm run dev`. The issue appears to be related to API endpoint configuration - the new implementation uses `/affiliates/v1/racing/meetings` while the working server-old implementation also uses this endpoint but with different headers and request structure.

#### Medium Severity

None identified.

#### Low Severity

1. The optional evening backfill job (Task 10, AC12) remains unimplemented, but this is correctly marked as optional in the story.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

All required acceptance criteria (AC1-AC11) have been successfully implemented:

1. **AC1**: Daily initialization runs at 6:00 AM NZST via node-cron scheduler
2. **AC2**: Fetches all meetings for current NZ race day from NZ TAB API
3. **AC3**: Fetches all race details including times, entrants, and initial odds
4. **AC4**: Uses NZ timezone fields (race_date_nz, start_time_nz) directly without UTC conversion
5. **AC5**: Populates meetings, races, and entrants tables with appropriate data
6. **AC6**: Uses bulk UPSERT operations for efficient data loading
7. **AC7**: Implements retry logic with max 3 retries and exponential backoff
8. **AC8**: Completes before dynamic scheduler starts (7:00 AM NZST) via startup gating
9. **AC9**: Logs comprehensive completion statistics using structured Pino logging
10. **AC10**: Scheduler integration verified with proper query pattern for start_time >= NOW()
11. **AC11**: Uses race_date_nz field for partition key alignment

### Test Coverage and Gaps

Test coverage is excellent with both unit and integration tests:

- Unit tests cover happy path, partial failures, and retry scenarios
- Integration tests verify end-to-end data persistence and scheduler query compatibility
- Tests validate proper handling of NZ timezone fields
- All tests pass (293 passed, 8 skipped)

### Architectural Alignment

The implementation aligns well with the Epic 2 technical specification:

- Follows the established pattern of dependency injection for testability
- Reuses existing components (NZ TAB client, bulk UPSERT functions)
- Maintains transactional integrity for database operations
- Implements proper error handling and structured logging
- Respects connection pool constraints

### Security Notes

No security concerns identified:

- Uses parameterized queries via existing bulk UPSERT functions
- Proper error handling prevents leaking sensitive information
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys in the code

### Best-Practices and References

The implementation follows several best practices:

1. **Dependency Injection**: Uses a clean dependency injection pattern for testability
2. **Error Boundaries**: Implements proper error handling with graceful degradation
3. **Structured Logging**: Uses Pino for consistent, structured log output
4. **Type Safety**: Maintains strict TypeScript typing throughout
5. **Modular Design**: Separates concerns into focused modules (daily-baseline, scheduler, types)

### Action Items

1. [High] Investigate and fix the 500 error occurring during daily initialization when running `npm run dev`
   - Compare request headers and parameters between the new implementation and the working server-old implementation
   - The issue appears to be related to API endpoint configuration or request formatting
   - Test with the exact same headers and request structure as used in server-old/api-client.js
2. [High] Verify that the NZ TAB API endpoints are being called with the correct parameters
   - Ensure the `/affiliates/v1/racing/meetings` endpoint is being called with the correct date parameters
   - Check that the partner headers (From, X-Partner, X-Partner-ID) match the working implementation
3. [Medium] Add more detailed error logging to the initialization process to help diagnose runtime issues
   - Log the exact request being made to the NZ TAB API
   - Log the full response when an error occurs
4. [Low] Implement the optional evening backfill job (Task 10, AC12) when the main issue is resolved

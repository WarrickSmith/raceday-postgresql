## Section Results

### Document Structure (Pass Rate: 7/8 - 88%)

✓ **Title includes story id and title**
Evidence: Line 1: `# Story 1.9: Health Check Endpoint`

✓ **Status set to Draft**
Evidence: Line 3: `Status: Draft`

✓ **Story section present with As a / I want / so that**
Evidence: Lines 5-9 contain complete user story format with role, action, and benefit clearly stated

✓ **Acceptance Criteria is a numbered list**
Evidence: Lines 11-18 contain seven acceptance criteria numbered 1-7 with source citations

✓ **Tasks/Subtasks present with checkboxes**
Evidence: Lines 20-44 contain five tasks with detailed subtasks, all properly formatted with checkboxes

✓ **Dev Notes includes architecture/testing context**
Evidence: Lines 46-87 include comprehensive sections: Requirements Context Summary, Technical Considerations, Testing Strategy, Project Structure Notes, and References

⚠ **Change Log table initialized**
Evidence: Change Log section is missing from the document
Impact: Minor - Change Log is typically added during implementation, not in draft stories. Recommended to add placeholder section for consistency with template.

✓ **Dev Agent Record sections present**
Evidence: Lines 89-97 include all required sections: Context Reference, Agent Model Used, Debug Log References, Completion Notes List, File List

### Content Quality (Pass Rate: 5/5 - 100%)

✓ **Acceptance Criteria sourced from epics/PRD**
Evidence: All seven ACs include explicit source citations:
- AC1: `[solution-architecture.md]`, `[tech-spec-epic-1.md]`
- AC2: `[tech-spec-epic-1.md]`, `[architecture-specification.md]`
- AC3-7: Similar comprehensive citations to authoritative sources

✓ **Tasks reference AC numbers where applicable**
Evidence: All tasks explicitly state which ACs they address:
- Task 1: "Set up Express server infrastructure (AC: 1, 7)"
- Task 2: "Implement /health route (AC: 2-5)"
- Task 3: "Migrate server entry point (AC: 1)"
- Task 4: "Update Docker healthcheck configuration (AC: 6)"
- Task 5: "Add integration tests for health endpoint (AC: 2-5)"

✓ **Dev Notes do not invent details; cite sources where possible**
Evidence: Dev Notes section (lines 46-87) extensively cites source documents including tech-spec-epic-1.md, solution-architecture.md, architecture-specification.md, CODING-STANDARDS.md, and Story 1.8. Technical decisions are grounded in architecture documentation.

✓ **File saved to stories directory from config**
Evidence: File saved to `/home/warrick/Dev/raceday-postgresql/docs/stories/story-1.9.md` matching the `dev_story_location` configuration value from `bmad/bmm/config.yaml`

✓ **Story enumerated in epics or tech spec**
Evidence: Story 1.9 is explicitly documented in `tech-spec-epic-1.md:721-729` as part of Epic 1's acceptance criteria checklist, confirming this story was planned and approved in the epic breakdown

### Optional Post-Generation (Pass Rate: 0/2 - N/A)

⚠ **Story Context generation run**
Evidence: Workflow configuration specifies `auto_run_context: true`, but Story Context workflow has not yet been invoked
Impact: Low - Story is complete and developer-ready without context. Context generation can be executed as a follow-up step.

➖ **Context Reference recorded in story**
Evidence: Line 91 contains placeholder comment: `<!-- Path(s) to story context XML/JSON will be added here by context workflow -->`
Reason: N/A until Story Context workflow executes and updates this section

## Failed Items

**None** - All required checklist items passed validation.

---

## Partial Items

### 1. Change Log Missing
**Item:** Change Log table initialized
**What's Missing:** Story document does not include a Change Log section as specified in the template
**Recommendation:** Add the following section before Dev Agent Record:

```markdown
## Change Log

| Date | Author | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2025-10-08 | Bob (SM Agent) | Initial story creation |
```

**Priority:** Low (cosmetic improvement)

### 2. Story Context Pending
**Item:** Story Context generation run
**What's Missing:** auto_run_context=true but context workflow not yet invoked
**Recommendation:** Execute Story Context workflow as specified in workflow Step 8 to generate XML context file
**Priority:** Medium (improves developer experience but not blocking)

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
**None** - Story meets all critical quality criteria

### Should Improve
1. **Add Change Log Section** - Include placeholder Change Log table for template consistency
2. **Execute Story Context Workflow** - Run `story-context` workflow to generate developer context XML as configured in `auto_run_context`

### Consider
1. **Expand Worker Pool Placeholder Note** - Add explicit TODO comment in Technical Considerations section noting that worker health check will be implemented in Epic 2 Story 2.X (specific story number once Epic 2 is broken down)

---

## Overall Assessment

Story 1.9 is **developer-ready** and meets all essential quality standards:

✅ **Structure:** Complete and well-organized
✅ **Traceability:** Full source citations to architecture documents
✅ **Clarity:** Clear acceptance criteria and task breakdown
✅ **Completeness:** Addresses Express migration and health check implementation comprehensively

**Minor improvements** (Change Log, Story Context) can be addressed during or after implementation without blocking development.

**Recommended Action:** Approve story for development. Optionally execute Story Context workflow to enhance developer experience.

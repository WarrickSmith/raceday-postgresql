**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**
Lines 16-22 capture 5 major tasks summarized from the story's 5 task groups:
- Create index migration script (AC: 1-6)
- Create query validation utility (AC: 7-11)
- Create integration tests (AC: 7-11)
- Execute migration and validate (AC: 1-7)
- Quality gate validation (AC: 8-11)

Tasks are appropriately summarized for context overview while maintaining traceability to acceptance criteria.

### Item 4: Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets

**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**
Lines 40-58: **4 documentation artifacts** included with paths, titles, sections, and detailed snippets:

1. `docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md` - Epic 1 Technical Specification (lines 41-147)
   - Complete index specifications for all 6 indexes with rationale
   - Performance targets and design decisions

2. `docs/epic-stories-2025-10-05.md` - Epic Stories (lines 85-98)
   - Story acceptance criteria and performance targets
   - EXPLAIN ANALYZE validation requirements

3. `docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md` - Coding Standards (lines 1-518)
   - ES6+ standards, TypeScript strict mode
   - Quality gate requirements

4. `docs/stories/story-1.3.md` - Story 1.3 Completion Notes (lines 196-204)
   - Lessons learned about partitioned table indexes
   - Partition pruning validation guidance

**Assessment:** 4 docs is within acceptable range (5-15 guideline). All docs are highly relevant and provide actionable implementation guidance. Quality over quantity achieved.

---

### Item 5: Relevant code references included with reason and line hints

**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**
Lines 59-88: **4 code artifacts** included with paths, kinds, line numbers, and detailed explanations:

1. `server/database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` (lines 17-67)
   - **Critical finding:** Identifies existing indexes that need fixing
   - Specific line numbers and detailed analysis of what's correct vs. needs update

2. `server/database/migrations/003_partitioned_tables.sql` (lines 32-33, 63-64)
   - Existing time-series indexes already satisfy AC #5 and #6
   - Verification guidance provided

3. `server/src/database/partitions.ts` (lines 1-67)
   - **Reference implementation** for ES6 patterns
   - Specific examples: ES modules, pure functions, pg-format, Pino logging

4. `server/src/database/migrate.ts`
   - Migration execution pattern reference
   - Error handling and transaction management examples

Each artifact includes clear reasoning for relevance to Story 1.4 implementation.

---

### Item 6: Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable

**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**
Lines 114-121: **2 interface definitions** extracted:

1. `Pool.query` (line 115-117)
   - Method signature: `query(sql: string, params?: any[]): Promise<QueryResult>`
   - Path: `node_modules/@types/pg`
   - Usage guidance: "Use with parameterized queries for safety"

2. `logger` (line 118-120)
   - Object signature: `{ info: (obj, msg) => void, warn: (obj, msg) => void, error: (obj, msg) => void }`
   - Path: `server/src/shared/logger.ts`
   - Usage guidance: "Use for all logging (no console methods)"

Both interfaces are directly applicable to the query validator utility and migration tasks.

---

### Item 7: Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns

**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**
Lines 100-112: **11 development constraints** extracted covering:

**SQL/Database Constraints:**
- Migration idempotency (CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS)
- DROP and recreate strategy for partial index WHERE clause changes
- Index column ordering requirements
- Partial index WHERE clause requirements
- DESC index optimization

**TypeScript/Code Quality Constraints:**
- ES modules with .js extensions (mandatory)
- Zero tolerance for `any` types
- TypeScript build and ESLint zero errors/warnings
- pg-format for SQL injection prevention
- Pino structured logging (no console methods)

All constraints are actionable and directly applicable to Story 1.4 implementation. Includes critical finding about needing to DROP/recreate two existing indexes.

---

### Item 8: Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks

**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**
Lines 89-97: **5 Node.js packages** detected with versions:

1. `pg@^8.13.1` - PostgreSQL client (typed Pool and query execution)
2. `pg-format@^1.0.4` - SQL identifier/literal escaping
3. `pino@^9.5.0` - Structured JSON logging
4. `vitest@^2.1.9` - Testing framework with TypeScript
5. `@vitest/coverage-v8@2.1.9` - Code coverage

All packages are directly relevant to Story 1.4 tasks (migration, query validation, testing). Versions are specific and match project standards.

---

### Item 9: Testing standards and locations populated

**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**

**Standards** (lines 124-132):
- Vitest framework with TypeScript strict mode
- 6 specific testing requirements:
  - Use describe/it/expect from vitest
  - async/await for database operations
  - Transactions with ROLLBACK for isolation
  - EXPLAIN ANALYZE verification for "Index Scan" (not "Seq Scan")
  - Coverage of both existence and usage
  - TypeScript/ESLint validation

**Locations** (lines 133-136):
- `server/tests/integration/indexes.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `server/tests/unit/query-validator.test.ts` - Unit tests (if utility created)

**Test Ideas** (lines 137-145):
- **7 specific test ideas** mapped to acceptance criteria #1-7
- Each idea includes example query patterns with WHERE clauses
- Partition pruning validation for time-series indexes (AC #5, #6)
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE parsing strategy (AC #7)

All three testing sections (standards, locations, ideas) are complete and actionable.

---

### Item 10: XML structure follows story-context template format

**Status:** ✓ **PASS**

**Evidence:**

**Template compliance verified:**

1. ✓ Root element: `<story-context>` (line 1)
2. ✓ Metadata section (lines 2-10): epicId, storyId, title, status, generatedAt, generator, sourceStoryPath
3. ✓ Story section (lines 12-23): asA, iWant, soThat, tasks
4. ✓ Acceptance criteria section (lines 25-37)
5. ✓ Artifacts section (lines 39-98): docs, code, dependencies
6. ✓ Constraints section (lines 100-112)
7. ✓ Interfaces section (lines 114-121)
8. ✓ Tests section (lines 123-146): standards, locations, ideas

**XML validity:**
- Proper nesting and closing tags
- HTML entity encoding for `<` as `&lt;` (lines 15, 42, 45, etc.)
- Consistent indentation
- All template placeholders replaced with actual content

Structure matches template exactly (bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-context/context-template.xml).

## Failed Items

**None** - All 10 checklist items passed validation.

---

## Partial Items

**None** - All items are fully complete with no gaps identified.

---

## Recommendations

### Strengths

1. **Excellent code artifact analysis** - The critical finding that 2 existing indexes need fixing (idx_races_start_time and idx_active_entrants) is invaluable and will save significant debugging time.

2. **Comprehensive constraints section** - 11 specific, actionable constraints provide clear implementation guidance and prevent common pitfalls.

3. **Test ideas mapped to ACs** - Each of the 7 test ideas directly maps to acceptance criteria with example query patterns, enabling immediate test implementation.

4. **Cross-story lessons learned** - Inclusion of Story 1.3 completion notes ensures knowledge transfer about partitioned table indexes.

### Optional Enhancements (Not Required for PASS)

1. **Consider adding** architectural decision records (ADRs) if any exist for database indexing strategy (currently none referenced, which is acceptable).

2. **Consider adding** PostgreSQL 18 specific documentation if performance features are leveraged (e.g., SIMD optimizations for index scans).

**Note:** These enhancements are optional optimizations. The current Story Context XML is complete and production-ready as-is.

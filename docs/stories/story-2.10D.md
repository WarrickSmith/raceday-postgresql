## Dev Notes

### Context & Background

This story implements **Integration & Performance Validation** as the final component of the Story 2.10 split sequence. It validates that the complete data pipeline delivers on the core migration promise: **2× performance improvement** (<15s for 5 concurrent races vs >30s in Appwrite).

**Story 2.10 Split Sequence:**
- **Story 2.10A** (Code Quality Foundation) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Story 2.10B** (Database Infrastructure & Partitions) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Story 2.10C** (Data Pipeline Processing) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Story 2.10D** (Integration & Performance Validation) - ← THIS STORY

**Key Validation Objectives:**

1. **End-to-End Flow**: Validate complete API → Transform → Database pipeline
2. **Performance Targets**: Verify <2s single race, <15s for 5 races (2× improvement)
3. **Data Quality**: Confirm mathematical consistency and completeness
4. **Load Resilience**: Test concurrent processing with failure isolation
5. **Client Compatibility**: Ensure API responses match Appwrite contract (zero client changes)

**Strategic Importance:**

This story is the **final validation gate** before Epic 2 completion. It confirms:
- All pipeline components work together correctly
- Performance targets are achievable in realistic scenarios
- Data quality meets production standards
- System handles load and failures gracefully
- Client applications can consume data without modification

Without this validation, the migration cannot proceed to shadow mode (Epic 5).

### Testing Strategy

**Integration Test Approach:**

1. **End-to-End Pipeline Test**:
   - Use realistic NZTAB API fixtures (or mock server)
   - Execute complete processRace() flow
   - Validate all database tables populated correctly
   - Verify data relationships (foreign keys)
   - Test partition routing for time-series tables
   - Measure and assert performance targets

2. **Performance Validation**:
   - Single race: Measure total duration, assert <2s
   - 5 concurrent races: Measure max duration, assert <15s
   - Component breakdown: Assert fetch <500ms, transform <1s, write <300ms
   - Use performance.now() for high-resolution timing
   - Run multiple iterations for statistical confidence

3. **Load Testing**:
   - Concurrent race processing with Promise.allSettled
   - Monitor PostgreSQL connection pool (should stay ≤10)
   - Monitor worker thread pool utilization
   - Test failure isolation (simulate API failure for one race)
   - Validate retry logic under load

4. **Client Compatibility**:
   - Query API endpoints (/api/meetings, /api/races, /api/entrants)
   - Compare response schemas to Appwrite contract
   - Validate snake_case field naming
   - Verify timestamp formats (ISO 8601, Pacific/Auckland)
   - Test API response times (<100ms p95)

**Benchmark Tool Features:**

- Run 1, 5, and 10 race scenarios
- Collect timing metrics: min, max, avg, p95, p99
- Breakdown by component: fetch, transform, write
- Export results to JSON/CSV
- Pass/fail validation against targets
- Support for synthetic and real NZTAB data
- Trend analysis (compare against baseline)

**Test Data Strategy:**

- Use real NZTAB API responses captured as fixtures
- Create synthetic data for edge cases (empty data, errors)
- Ensure fixtures include all new fields (race pools, incremental money flow)
- Test database seeding for baseline comparisons
- Cleanup strategy (rollback transactions or test database reset)

### Performance Considerations

**Test Environment:**

- Use test database with production-like schema
- Ensure partitions exist for test date ranges
- Configure realistic connection pool (10 max)
- Use 3-worker thread pool (production configuration)

**Measurement Accuracy:**

- Use `performance.now()` for microsecond precision
- Run multiple iterations (3-5) for statistical confidence
- Measure cold start vs warm start performance
- Account for test overhead (setup, teardown)

**Expected Results:**

Based on Stories 2.1-2.10C implementation:
- Single race: 1.5-2s (within budget)
- 5 concurrent races: 10-15s (target achieved)
- Component breakdown validated in unit tests
- Load handling demonstrated in concurrent tests

**Performance Regression Prevention:**

- Establish baseline metrics from this story
- Use benchmark tool in CI/CD for regression detection
- Alert on >10% degradation from baseline
- Document performance in DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md

### Known Risks & Mitigations

**Risk: Flaky Performance Tests**

Network latency and system load can cause timing variations.

*Mitigation:*
- Use configurable thresholds (e.g., 2s ± 10%)
- Run multiple iterations, use median/p95
- Provide mock NZTAB server option for deterministic testing
- Document expected variance in test comments

**Risk: Test Database State Pollution**

Previous test runs may leave data that affects results.

*Mitigation:*
- Use transaction rollback for test cleanup
- Create dedicated test database schema
- Add `beforeEach` cleanup in test setup
- Verify partition cleanup (drop test partitions)

**Risk: Connection Pool Exhaustion**

Concurrent tests may saturate the connection pool.

*Mitigation:*
- Monitor pool metrics during tests
- Configure test pool size (10 connections)
- Add connection leak detection
- Test pool recovery after saturation

**Risk: Worker Thread Crashes Under Load**

High concurrency may expose worker thread issues.

*Mitigation:*
- Include worker crash scenarios in load tests
- Verify auto-restart logic (Story 2.12 dependency)
- Test graceful degradation (reduced worker count)
- Monitor worker error events

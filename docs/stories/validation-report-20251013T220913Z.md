### Senior Developer Review - Validation Checklist
Pass Rate: 17/18 (94.4%)

✓ Story file loaded from `docs/stories/story-2.8.md`
Evidence: Confirmed full document review including change log and new review section (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:1-140).

✓ Story Status verified as one of: Ready for Review, Review
Evidence: Status read as `Ready for Review` prior to workflow execution and subsequently updated to `InProgress` after logging Changes Requested (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:3).

✓ Epic and Story IDs resolved (2.8)
Evidence: Story metadata and context confirm epic/story IDs (docs/stories/story-context-2.8.xml:5-8).

✓ Story Context located or warning recorded
Evidence: Loaded `docs/stories/story-context-2.8.xml` and used as authoritative reference for ACs and artifacts (docs/stories/story-context-2.8.xml:1-210).

✓ Epic Tech Spec located or warning recorded
Evidence: Reviewed Epic 2 tech spec acceptance criteria covering Promise.allSettled batching and observability (docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:160-220).

✓ Architecture/standards docs loaded (as available)
Evidence: Consulted solution architecture section describing race processor orchestration (docs/solution-architecture.md:300-332).

✓ Tech stack detected and documented
Evidence: Verified Node.js/TypeScript stack and dependencies via server/package.json (server/package.json:1-52).

✗ MCP doc search performed (or web fallback) and references captured
Evidence: No MCP/web lookup executed during this review session; relied solely on repo documentation.
Impact: Lacks corroborating external guidance that workflow expects for best-practice cross-checks.

✓ Acceptance Criteria cross-checked against implementation
Evidence: Evaluated AC1-AC8 against code/t tests; identified failures for metrics handling (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:97-136; server/src/pipeline/race-processor.ts:600-754).

✓ File List reviewed and validated for completeness
Evidence: Confirmed file list matches touched modules/tests in Dev Agent Record (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:122-131).

✓ Tests identified and mapped to ACs; gaps noted
Evidence: Reviewed new unit/integration tests and recorded missing coverage for failure durations (server/tests/unit/pipeline/race-processor.test.ts:535-704; server/tests/integration/pipeline/race-processor.integration.test.ts:320-612).

✓ Code quality review performed on changed files
Evidence: Assessed concurrency adjustments, metrics aggregation, and test fixtures; logged findings in review notes (server/src/pipeline/race-processor.ts:600-754).

✓ Security review performed on changed files and dependencies
Evidence: No new surface area introduced; transactional writes maintained and no dependency changes detected (server/package.json:1-52).

✓ Outcome decided (Approve/Changes Requested/Blocked)
Evidence: Outcome recorded as Changes Requested in review section (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:139-187).

✓ Review notes appended under "Senior Developer Review (AI)"
Evidence: New section documents summary, findings, and action items (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:139-187).

✓ Change Log updated with review entry
Evidence: Change Log includes 2025-10-14 review entry (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:133-136).

✓ Status updated according to settings (if enabled)
Evidence: Story status set to `InProgress` per changes-requested outcome (docs/stories/story-2.8.md:3).

✓ Story saved successfully
Evidence: Story file and status trackers committed to workspace with updates present (git status -sb; docs/project-workflow-status-2025-10-13.md:1-140).

## Failed Items
- MCP doc search performed (or web fallback) and references captured — Not executed; add MCP/web lookup or document rationale in future runs.

## Partial Items
- None.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Execute MCP or web-based best-practice lookup (or document unavailability) in future review runs to satisfy workflow expectation.
2. Should Improve: N/A.
3. Consider: N/A.

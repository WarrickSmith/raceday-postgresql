## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Implement the worker pool, worker script, startup wiring, and logging to satisfy AC1–AC9 and unblock delivery.
2. Should Improve: Populate the story's File List with actual code artifacts once implemented to aid future reviews.
3. Consider: Automate a smoke test ensuring worker infrastructure is initialized during application bootstrap.

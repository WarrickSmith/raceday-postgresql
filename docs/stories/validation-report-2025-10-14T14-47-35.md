## Failed Items
- None

## Partial Items
- MCP doc search performed (or web fallback) and references captured – External tooling unavailable; rerun with MCP/web when possible to augment references.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: Execute an MCP or web best-practices search when tooling access is restored to supplement internal references.
3. Consider: None.

## Checklist Review

1. ✅ Story fields captured — `<asA>`, `<iWant>`, `<soThat>` populated from story draft (docs/stories/story-context-2.8.xml:9-15).
2. ✅ Acceptance criteria match story draft verbatim — eight numbered items mirror docs/stories/story-2.8.md (docs/epics.md#L76-L91, story-context:21-33).
3. ✅ Tasks/subtasks included — hierarchical bullet list carries every task head and sub-task from story (story-context:17-30).
4. ✅ Docs list contains five relevant references with snippets: epics, PRD, tech spec, architecture spec, solution architecture (story-context:38-57).
5. ✅ Code references include module, unit and integration tests, worker pool, and DB pool with rationale (story-context:58-78).
6. ✅ Interfaces/API contracts extracted — ProcessOptions/ProcessResult, processRaces signature, and stage error classes documented (story-context:90-104).
7. ✅ Constraints call out pool limit, pipeline reuse, and logging requirements (story-context:80-86).
8. ✅ Dependencies detected from package manifest — npm ecosystem entry lists pg, pino, axios, zod, express, vitest (story-context:70-77).
9. ✅ Testing standards/locations populated — developer quick start commands plus unit/integration folders and test ideas (story-context:106-117).
10. ✅ XML adheres to story-context template structure; all sections present and CDATA used to preserve formatting (manual inspection).

## Recommendations
None — story context meets all checklist requirements.

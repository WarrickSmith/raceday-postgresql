## Failed Items

**None** - All checklist items passed validation.

---

## Partial Items

**None** - No partial compliance issues identified.

## Recommendations

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 10 acceptance criteria fully represented across docs, code, constraints, interfaces, and tests
2. **Precise Citations**: All documentation references include specific line numbers for traceability
3. **Developer-Ready**: Complete interface signatures, type definitions, and reusable code references
4. **Test Coverage**: 8 test ideas provide complete coverage of all 10 acceptance criteria
5. **No Invention**: All content grounded in existing documentation and code

### Minor Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Code Artifact Enhancement**: Consider adding actual schema definitions for MoneyFlowRecord and OddsRecord types from messages.ts once available
2. **Performance Baselines**: Could add baseline timing data from Story 2.5 benchmarks as reference for 300ms budget
3. **Example SQL**: Could include example SQL statement for partition detection query using pg_class/pg_inherits

**Note:** These enhancements are optional improvements. The context is already complete and production-ready as-is.

### Story Context Assembly Validation

Pass Rate: 9/10 (90%)

#### ✓ PASS - Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
**Evidence:** Lines 13-15 of story-context-1.2.xml
```xml
<asA>a developer</asA>
<iWant>core database tables (meetings, races, entrants, race_pools) created via migration scripts</iWant>
<soThat>I can store normalized race data with proper constraints and relationships</soThat>
```
Matches story-1.2.md lines 7-9 exactly.

#### ✓ PASS - Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
**Evidence:** Lines 27-36 contain all 10 acceptance criteria matching story-1.2.md lines 13-22 verbatim. No additional criteria were invented. Each criterion ID maps correctly to the source story.

#### ✓ PASS - Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
**Evidence:** Lines 16-23 contain 6 tasks with proper AC mappings:
```xml
<task id="1" status="pending">Configure ESLint for TypeScript server code (AC: 7, 8, 9, 10)</task>
<task id="2" status="pending">Create database migration utility in TypeScript (AC: 7, 8, 9, 10)</task>
<task id="3" status="pending">Create SQL migration scripts (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)</task>
<task id="4" status="pending">Create migration test suite (AC: 7, 8, 9, 10)</task>
<task id="5" status="pending">Execute migrations and validate (AC: 1-6)</task>
<task id="6" status="pending">Quality gate validation (AC: 7, 8, 9, 10)</task>
```
Task structure aligns with story-1.2.md lines 26-82.

#### ⚠ PARTIAL - Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
**Evidence:** Lines 40-52 contain 4 documentation references:
1. docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md (Core Tables section, lines 40-167)
2. docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md (Migration Scripts Organization section, lines 581-605)
3. docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md (TypeScript Best Practices section, lines 169-238)
4. docs/typescript-eslint-config.md (ESLint Configuration section, lines 92-223)

**Gap:** Only 4 docs listed, below the recommended 5-15 range. Missing potential high-level references:
- PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- HLA (High-Level Architecture)
- Epic overview documentation
- API design documents (if applicable)
- Database architecture overview

**Impact:** While the included docs are highly relevant and sufficient for implementation, additional context from PRD/HLA would provide better business context and architectural alignment. This is a minor issue as the technical references are comprehensive.

#### ✓ PASS - Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
**Evidence:** Lines 54-57 contain 3 code artifacts with clear justifications:
```xml
<artifact path="server/src/database" kind="directory" ... reason="Empty directory created in Story 1.1 - ready for migrate.ts implementation" />
<artifact path="server/package.json" kind="manifest" ... reason="Existing package.json with pg dependency, ESLint/Prettier scripts already configured, type:module for ES6 imports" />
<artifact path="server/tsconfig.json" kind="config" ... reason="TypeScript configuration with strict mode, ES2022 target, ESNext modules - ready for strict type checking" />
```
Each artifact includes path, kind, line hints, and clear reason for relevance.

#### ✓ PASS - Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
**Evidence:** Lines 98-104 define two critical interfaces:
```xml
<interface name="Pool" kind="class" signature="import { Pool } from 'pg'" path="node_modules/pg">
  PostgreSQL connection pool - use pool.query(sql: string) to execute migrations. Must be properly typed, no any.
</interface>
<interface name="MigrationResult" kind="interface" signature="{ file: string; success: boolean; error?: string }" path="server/src/database/migrate.ts">
  Return type for migration runner - tracks success/failure per migration file
</interface>
```
Properly extracted with signatures, paths, and usage context.

#### ✓ PASS - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
**Evidence:** Lines 87-96 contain 9 comprehensive constraints:
- Architecture (ES6+ functional programming)
- TypeScript (strict typing, no any)
- Linting (ESLint with pre-commit hooks)
- Imports (explicit .js extensions - Story 1.1 lesson)
- Exports (named exports only)
- Database (idempotent migrations, sequential numbering)
- Testing (transaction cleanup)
- SQL (case-sensitive identifiers - Story 1.1 lesson)
- Migration structure (separation of concerns)

All constraints are actionable and directly applicable to the story implementation.

#### ✓ PASS - Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
**Evidence:** Lines 59-84 comprehensively list:
- **Runtime dependencies (2):** pg ^8.16.3, dotenv ^16.6.1
- **DevDependencies (10):** Including current versions and upgrade requirements (e.g., "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^8.0.0" → "MUST UPGRADE to ^8.19.1")
- **Packages to install (4):** eslint-config-airbnb-typescript, eslint-plugin-import, husky, lint-staged

Dependencies are properly categorized with versions and purposes clearly stated.

#### ✓ PASS - Testing standards and locations populated
**Evidence:** Lines 106-121 include:
- **Standards (line 107):** "Use Vitest test framework with TypeScript. Integration tests connect to PostgreSQL using pg.Pool. All tests must follow strict TypeScript rules (no any types). Test files use .test.ts extension..."
- **Locations (lines 108-111):** server/tests/integration/*.test.ts and server/tests/unit/*.test.ts
- **Test ideas (lines 112-120):** 7 test scenarios mapped to acceptance criteria (table existence, primary keys, foreign keys, CHECK constraints, TIMESTAMPTZ, triggers, ESLint/TypeScript validation)

Comprehensive testing guidance provided.

#### ✓ PASS - XML structure follows story-context template format
**Evidence:** Document structure validates against template:
- `<metadata>` (lines 2-10): epicId, storyId, title, status, generatedAt, generator, sourceStoryPath
- `<story>` (lines 12-24): asA, iWant, soThat, tasks
- `<acceptanceCriteria>` (lines 26-37): criterion elements with ids
- `<artifacts>` (lines 39-85): docs, code, dependencies sections
- `<constraints>` (lines 87-97): constraint elements with types
- `<interfaces>` (lines 98-105): interface definitions
- `<tests>` (lines 106-121): standards, locations, ideas

All required sections present with proper XML structure.

## Partial Items

### ⚠ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
**What's missing:** Additional high-level documentation references (PRD, HLA, epic overview) to provide broader business and architectural context.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding references to:
1. Product Requirements Document (if available)
2. High-Level Architecture documentation
3. Epic 1 overview/summary document
4. Database design philosophy or architectural decision records

**Priority:** Low - Current technical documentation is sufficient for implementation, but additional context would improve strategic alignment.

## Recommendations

### 1. Should Improve: Expand documentation references
Add 1-3 high-level documentation references to meet the 5-15 recommended range. This would provide better business context and architectural alignment for the developer implementing the story.

**Suggested additions:**
- PRD or epic overview for business context
- High-level architecture document for system-wide context
- Database design patterns or ADRs if available

### 2. Consider: Validation automation
The story context is well-formed and comprehensive. Consider creating a validation script that can automatically check story context files against the checklist to catch issues earlier in the workflow.

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS

The story context document is of high quality with 90% pass rate. All critical requirements are met:
- Story structure is complete and accurate
- Acceptance criteria match the source story exactly
- Technical references are comprehensive and actionable
- Constraints capture lessons learned from Story 1.1
- Testing guidance is thorough

The single partial item (documentation count) is a minor issue that does not block story implementation. The included documentation provides all necessary technical details for successful execution.

---

✓ **PASS** - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns

**Evidence:** Lines 220-230 define 9 architectural and development constraints

Constraints captured:
1. Architecture: Worker threads required for CPU-intensive calculations
2. Performance: <1s per race transform budget
3. Type-safety: Zero `any` types enforced
4. Functional: Pure functions only (deterministic, no side effects)
5. Compatibility: Reproduce server-old formulas exactly
6. Data-flow: RaceData input → TransformedRace output pipeline
7. File-structure: Follow Story 2.3 patterns, new money-flow.ts file
8. Testing: 100% coverage on calculation logic, regression fixtures
9. Module-system: ES modules exclusively with .js extensions

Each constraint type-tagged (architecture, performance, type-safety, etc.) and includes specific requirements relevant to Story 2.4.

---

✓ **PASS** - Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks

**Evidence:** Lines 195-217 enumerate production and dev dependencies

**Production dependencies (9):**

- Example: "zod ^3.25.76 - Runtime validation for transform outputs and worker messages"

**Dev dependencies (8):**
- typescript, tsx, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged
- Each with usage context
- Example: "@vitest/coverage-v8 ^2.1.9 - Code coverage reporting (target 100% on calculation logic)"

Dependencies aligned with server/package.json from Epic 1 foundation. All relevant to Story 2.4 implementation and testing.

---

✓ **PASS** - Testing standards and locations populated

**Evidence:** Lines 270-290 define comprehensive testing approach

**Testing standards (lines 271-273):**
- Framework: vitest (established in Epic 1)
- Unit tests: validate calculation functions in isolation
- Integration tests: end-to-end worker message handling
- Regression tests: compare against server-old fixtures
- Coverage targets: 100% on money-flow.ts, >90% on transformWorker.ts

**Testing locations (lines 274-278):**
- server/tests/unit/workers/money-flow.test.ts
- server/tests/integration/workers/transform-worker.integration.test.ts
- server/tests/fixtures/money-flow-legacy/

**Test ideas (lines 279-289):**
- 9 specific test scenarios mapped to acceptance criteria
- Examples:
  - AC3: "Unit test calculateHoldPercentage with various pool scenarios: zero pool, negative pool (invalid), normal pool, edge case with scratched entrant"
  - AC11: "Performance test: Measure transform duration for race with 1 entrant, 10 entrants, 20 entrants (realistic maximum). Assert all scenarios complete <1s"

Complete testing strategy defined with clear guidance for implementation.

✓ **PASS** - XML structure follows story-context template format

**Evidence:** Entire document structure (lines 1-292)

**Template compliance verified:**

- Acceptance criteria section: numbered list with citations (lines 69-81)
- Artifacts section with docs, code, dependencies subsections (lines 83-218)
- Constraints section: type-tagged constraint list (lines 220-230)
- Interfaces section: structured interface definitions (lines 232-268)
- Tests section: standards, locations, ideas (lines 270-290)

## Recommendations

### Strengths

1. **Excellent Documentation Coverage:** 12 docs spanning tech spec, architecture, PRD, coding standards, and related stories provide comprehensive context without overwhelming the developer.

2. **Well-Defined Interfaces:** 5 critical interfaces documented with clear signatures, paths, and usage notes enable smooth integration with Story 2.3 worker infrastructure.

3. **Actionable Test Ideas:** 9 test scenarios mapped to specific acceptance criteria provide clear testing roadmap with edge cases and performance validation.

4. **Strong Constraints Documentation:** 9 constraints cover architecture, performance, type-safety, functional programming, and compatibility requirements that guide implementation decisions.

5. **Clear Task Structure:** 39 subtasks organized into 7 logical groups with AC references make it easy for developers to track progress and understand requirements.

### Optional Enhancements (Not Required)

1. **Consider Adding:** Example money flow calculation formulas from server-old in a code snippet (if available) to reduce discovery time for developers.

2. **Consider Adding:** Link to NZ TAB API documentation (if publicly available) for reference when validating calculation inputs.

3. **Consider Adding:** Estimated complexity/effort per task group to help with sprint planning.

These are minor suggestions only - the current context XML fully satisfies all checklist requirements and provides excellent developer guidance.

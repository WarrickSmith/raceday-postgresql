### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

[✓ PASS] Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Evidence: `<asA>`, `<iWant>`, and `<soThat>` populated in docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:13-15 aligned with story-2.5.md:7-9.

[✓ PASS] Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Evidence: Items 1-9 in docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:36-44 mirror docs/stories/story-2.5.md:13-21, including change-detection, transaction, logging, and performance requirements.

[✓ PASS] Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Evidence: Nested checklist under `<tasks>` at docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:16-33 reproduces Tasks / Subtasks section in docs/stories/story-2.5.md:25-42.

[✓ PASS] Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Evidence: Six `<doc>` entries in docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:48-83 reference epics, tech spec, architecture, PRD, solution architecture, and coding standards with verbatim snippets.

[✓ PASS] Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Evidence: `<code><file>` entries at docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:85-120 cite pool.ts, query-validator.ts, transformWorker.ts, messages.ts, and logger.ts with rationale and line spans.

[✓ PASS] Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
Evidence: docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:149-177 lists pool singleton, TransformedRace schema, validateIndexUsage, and logger interface usage.

[✓ PASS] Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
Evidence: docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:140-147 captures performance, transactional, architecture, database, pooling, logging, and type-safety constraints tied to the story.

[✓ PASS] Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Evidence: docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:122-136 enumerates runtime (`pg`, `pg-format`, `pino`, `zod`, `dotenv`) and dev tooling (`typescript`, `vitest`, `@types/pg`, `eslint`, `prettier`).

[✓ PASS] Testing standards and locations populated
Evidence: `<tests>` block at docs/stories/story-context-2.5.xml:179-193 defines standards, file locations, and acceptance criteria-aligned test ideas.

[✓ PASS] XML structure follows story-context template format
Evidence: Document retains template sections (metadata, story, acceptanceCriteria, artifacts, constraints, interfaces, tests) with no remaining `{{placeholder}}` markers (confirmed via search).

## Failed Items
- None

## Partial Items
- None

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None

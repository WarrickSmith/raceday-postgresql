# Story 1.10: Development Environment Setup Documentation

Status: ContextReadyDraft

## Story

As a developer new to the raceday-postgresql project,
I want comprehensive documentation for setting up the local development environment,
so that I can get started quickly and consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. developer-quick-start.md includes complete setup instructions for Node.js 22 LTS, Docker, and Docker Compose prerequisites
2. developer-quick-start.md documents step-by-step setup process: clone repo, install dependencies, start Docker, run migrations
3. developer-quick-start.md documents common development commands: npm run dev, npm run build, npm test
4. developer-quick-start.md includes a troubleshooting section for common issues
5. server/.env.example provides a complete template for all required environment variables
6. Documentation references Epic 1 technical specifications for additional context

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

Story 1.10 requires comprehensive documentation for setting up the local development environment. The documentation should enable new developers to get started quickly and consistently with the raceday-postgresql project. This includes clear prerequisites, step-by-step setup instructions, common commands, and troubleshooting guidance.

The developer-quick-start.md file already exists and appears to be comprehensive (538 lines), but this story ensures it fully meets all acceptance criteria and is properly maintained as the project evolves.

### Project Structure Notes

**Existing Documentation:**

- docs/developer-quick-start.md - Comprehensive 538-line guide
- server/.env.example - Environment variable template with comments
- docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md - Technical specifications for Epic 1
- docs/architecture-specification.md - System architecture documentation

**Alignment with Architecture:**
The documentation should align with the dual-deployment architecture where server and client are deployed separately, with PostgreSQL deployed independently. The setup instructions should reflect this architecture.

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** backend (Backend/API Service)
- **Project Level:** 2
- **Instruction Set:** Level 2 delivery (Phases 2 → 4)
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** brownfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Migrate the Raceday betting intelligence platform from Appwrite to a custom Node.js 22 + PostgreSQL 18 stack with 2× performance.
- **Estimated Stories:** 44-55 across 5 epics
- **Estimated Epics:** 5
- **Timeline:** 5-week implementation cadence (Week 1 foundation → Week 5 migration)

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** PRD, solution architecture, epic-level tech specs, coding standards, developer quick start
- **Team Size:** 1 (warrick)
- **Deployment Intent:** Production migration with zero downtime (shadow mode → phased cutover)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

- PRD, epics, and tech specs reviewed and confirmed for Level 2 scope
- Story backlog, TODO queue, and DONE ledger initialized in status file
- Next workflow step set for Scrum Master to continue delivery cycle

### Workflow Sequence

1. SM agent iterates `create-story` → `story-ready` → `story-context` for each queued story
2. DEV agent cycles `dev-story` → `story-approved`, keeping status file updated
3. PM agent periodically reviews velocity and backlog health via `workflow-status`

### Next Actions

- Run `story-ready` to review Story 2.8 and promote it for development
- Keep status file in sync after each workflow (`story-ready`, `dev-story`, `story-approved`)
- Revisit `workflow-status` after each sprint slice to reassess priorities

## Special Considerations

- Existing documentation is comprehensive; focus planning workflow on aligning status tracking with approved artifacts.
- Maintain strict sequence for story progression (BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE) once Phase 4 begins.
- Performance targets (5 races <15s) remain the primary success metric—ensure they stay visible in planning and status updates.

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Node.js 22 LTS + TypeScript strict mode
- PostgreSQL 18 with partitioned time-series tables
- Worker-thread based money-flow transforms with Promise.allSettled orchestration
- Strict linting/testing gates (ESLint, Vitest, npm audit) before story approval

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 0 (Single Atomic Change)

- **Format:** `story-<short-title>.md`
- **Example:** `story-icon-migration.md`, `story-login-fix.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** 1 (if more needed, consider Level 1)

### Level 1 (Coherent Feature)

- **Format:** `story-<title>-<n>.md`
- **Example:** `story-oauth-integration-1.md`, `story-oauth-integration-2.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** 2-3 (prefer longer stories over more stories)

### Level 2+ (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in epics.md

## Decision Log

### Planning Decisions Made

- **2025-10-13**: Classified project as Level 2 brownfield backend migration; initialized workflow tracker with plan-project as next action.
- **2025-10-13**: Confirmed existing planning artifacts, seeded story backlog, and advanced workflow to Scrum Master execution.
- **2025-10-13**: Completed create-story for Story 2.8 (Parallel Race Processing); story awaiting review via `story-ready`.
- **2025-10-13**: Story 2.8 marked Ready; moved to IN PROGRESS and promoted Story 2.9 to TODO for drafting.
- **2025-10-13**: Generated story-context for Story 2.8 and queued DEV handoff.

## Agent Usage Guide

### For SM (Scrum Master) Agent

**When to use this file:**

- Running `create-story` workflow → Read "TODO (Needs Drafting)" once populated after planning
- Running `story-ready` workflow → Update status file, move story from TODO → IN PROGRESS, move next story from BACKLOG → TODO
- Checking epic/story progress → Read "Epic/Story Summary" after Phase 4 initialization

**Key fields to read:**

- `todo_story_id` → The story ID to draft (populated during Phase 4 initialization)
- `todo_story_title` → The story title for drafting
- `todo_story_file` → The exact file path to create

**Key fields to update:**

- Move completed TODO story → IN PROGRESS section
- Move next BACKLOG story → TODO section
- Update story counts

**Workflows:**

1. `create-story` - Drafts the story in TODO section (user reviews it)
2. `story-ready` - After user approval, moves story TODO → IN PROGRESS

### For DEV (Developer) Agent

**When to use this file:**

- Running `dev-story` workflow → Read "IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)" once populated
- Running `story-approved` workflow → Update status file, move story from IN PROGRESS → DONE, move TODO story → IN PROGRESS, move BACKLOG story → TODO
- Checking what to work on → Read "IN PROGRESS" section

**Key fields to read:**

- `current_story_file` → The story to implement
- `current_story_context_file` → The context XML for this story
- `current_story_status` → Current status (Ready | In Review)

**Key fields to update:**

- Move completed IN PROGRESS story → DONE section with completion date
- Move TODO story → IN PROGRESS section
- Move next BACKLOG story → TODO section
- Update story counts and points

**Workflows:**

1. `dev-story` - Implements the story in IN PROGRESS section
2. `story-approved` - After user approval (DoD complete), moves story IN PROGRESS → DONE

### For PM (Product Manager) Agent

**When to use this file:**

- Checking overall progress → Read "Phase Completion Status"
- Planning next phase → Read "Overall Progress" percentage
- Course correction → Read "Decision Log" for context

**Key fields:**

- `progress_percentage` → Overall project progress
- `current_phase` → What phase are we in
- `artifacts` table → What's been generated
